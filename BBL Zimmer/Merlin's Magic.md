#Merlins Magic
by BBL
  
  
James slammed his bedroom door in frustration and slumped himself onto his bed. Staring up at the ceiling he gritted his teeth and tried to restrain the urge he felt to tell his fathers girlfriend exactly what he was thinking at the precise moment in time.   
  
James’s father was a Naval officer and very high ranking his house was large and befitted his rank as normal he was on maneuvers half way around the world and spent little time at home only  when leave permitted it. This suited James just fine , his parents had split up about a year ago when he turned eighteen because his dad was caught out with another woman the same woman who James was currently holding back the urge to confront and let know that he wasn’t going to stand by and let her tell him what he could and couldn’t do. Since James began higher education and needed to move closer to London he eagerly left his mother to live with his father as his huge house was ideally located for commuting plus he got to live there alone or atleast that was true until six months ago. His fathers girlfriend Melinda moved in with her daughter and suddenly his life style was dramatically altered. Gone were  the all night parties with his University friends and his ability to entertain at the house and this really rubbed James up the wrong way.  James was cool about his father and Melinda he knew several years back his mother and father had no future and both would be happier apart and as for his father well he had scored with a good looking thirty something year old blonde who even James found very attractive. James and Melinda got on well in general and he really didn’t have an issue with her until she moved in and he found how this cramped his style. Recently she had started to position herself as the head of the house and that he should respect her wishes whilst he lived there. James paid little attention but they had started to have the odd confrontation over his behaviour such as Melinda reminding him to pull his weight around the house cleaning  and to inform her where he was going and the times he would be expected in and out etc , this grated on James a great deal so used to his freedom before.  
  
He heard a faint tap on his door and the sweet voice of Kelly asking if it was alright to come in.  
  
“Sure” James replied and sat up on  the bed. In entered Kelly, Melinda’s near seventeen year old daughter and another new occupant of the house. James didn’t at all mind Kelly however she was a cute schoolgirl in his opinion with long straight natural blonde hair and big baby blue eyes sort of the little sister he never had. She was a fun girl too and James and her hit it off from the word go he thought she may have a bit of a crush on him  but perhaps this was his own imagination, however she did seem to chat with him about everything and anything as if to make excuses to spend time with him and seemed quite flirty on occasion. James didn’t mind this she was a pretty girl and he felt flattered.  
  
“Hey Kelly whats up?”  
  
“Oh I heard you and mum downstairs im sorry I know she can go on a bit. I did try to clear your empty beer cans away in the kitchen but she saw me and well you know the rest”  
  
“Yeh , hey thanks Kelly . I would have got around to slinging them in the trash but she wants everything like immediately I cant handle that Im not a kid and she really needs reminding of that”  
  
Kelly sat on the edge of James’s desk and he couldn’t help but check out one of her smooth legs revealed from her towelling dressing gown.   
  
“You know she is a little freaky if you don’t mind me saying Kelly “  
  
Kelly smirked “why what did she do?”  
  
“Its not so much what she did but she gave me a real weird look and said something like I needed to learn to respect her and look up to her and she would see to it that I did so. I told her Im a man not a kid and I don’t think she liked me standing up to her. I just looked down at her and smiled and said don’t push me Melinda and she didn’t like that at all. She got very defensive and said if I carry on in this manor one day she would cut me down to size , man she’s weird”  
  
“erm James perhaps you should try to get along with mum , meet her half way you know she can be well , lets just say mums full of surprises and she does like to prove a point”  
  
“We do get along most of the time Kelly but when she tries to tell me what to do I cant help it Im just not used to it especially at home”  
  
Kelly and James chatted for half and hour or so and James went downstairs to make the piece with Melinda. She was sat on the sofa before the open fire place sipping some wine and looking quite alluring in a black summer dress, Melinda was an older version of Kelly perhaps less endowed up top but she had the same good figure but with a cropped blonde haircut which made her look older but to many she would pass as Kelly’s older sister rather than mother.  
  
“Don’t worry James I think from now on you and I will get along much better I have a feeling you in time you and I will see more eye to eye”  
  
Melinda grinned strangely and James again felt an unease about her tone but let it go and went to bed. The weekend past and James and Melinda didn’t have any issues at all but perhaps this was because he had stayed away on the Saturday night at his friend Paul’s house so they could hit the town and a few clubs. When he returned late Sunday night he found Melinda ironing in the kitchen and she seemed in a good mood.   
  
“Hey Melinda”  
  
“Hi James , good night last night?”  
  
“the best we hit a club in the west end it was pretty happening”  
  
“Ages since I last hit the town I will have to arrange a girls night out”  
  
“You should let you hair down a bit Melinda and enjoy yourself”  
  
“Perhaps you can show me some of the hot spots eh”  
  
James smiled and was about to fix himself a drink when Melinda passed him a supermarket bag.  
  
“Hey James I felt bad about us falling out the other night so I got you these , they are Belgium I think the ones you like to drink?”  
  
He peered in the bag taking the gift off of her and she had bought him six bottles of his favourite Belgium beer.  
  
“Hey thanks Melinda you shouldn’t have”  
  
He lent down and kissed her cheek and she smiled back.  
  
“just do me two favours will you James “  
  
“Name it”  
  
“Well first could you hide those beers on the top shelf up there where Kelly cant see or reach them   
  
I don’t want her giving that strong stuff to one of those immature hormone crazed boys she and her friends hang out with.”  
  
“No problem” James complied stretching his 6ft frame on his tip toes to the awkward shelf above and tucking the beers back to the wall.  
  
“Thanks you’re a darling she’s a couple of inches taller than me so she wont notice them now.  
  
James looked down at Melinda , she was about 5 foot 3.   
  
“What was the other favour?”  
  
“Oh Kelly came in an hour ago wouldn’t speak to me but I guess she has fallen out with her boyfriend or something cause I saw him kick the fence in frustration as he walked up the drive , she’s up in her room , you get on with her would you check she’s alright for me?”  
  
“Sure Im gonna hit the sack anyway so Ill have a word”  
  
James walked upstairs feeling refreshed on the home front for a change Melinda seem to be genuine and hell that was dam good beer he thought to himself!  
  
He knocked on Kelly bedroom  door and heard music within she was listening to Robbie Williams latest album ,  
  
“come in”  
  
James stepped into her typical girly room , soft pink painted walls adorned by teen pop idol posters and dressing table and cabinet over run with soft cuddly toys. Kelly was in her bed and reached over to knock the volume down on her hi-fi.   
  
“Good track I haven’t got his latest album” James began  
  
“Ill make you a copy” she beamed “did you have a good night out”  
”yeh pretty hot went to check a few new clubs out”  
  
“really,  what ones , where”  
  
“In the west end, one called Anarchy ”  
  
“Hey Tara and I wanted to go there, they’ve run live gigs there dont they?”  
  
“Yeh, thats the one, some class acts but its over twenty ones Kelly and your”  
  
“I can look older if I want to , you haven’t really seen me dressed up”   
  
Kelly interrupted as if to stop him saying your too young.  
  
“Maybe you could take me one night?”  
  
“Im not sure Melinda would approve of me leading her daughter astray”  
  
Kelly sat up a little and was obviously not wearing anything as she held the duvet up to her bust  
  
partially obscuring it.James couldn’t help but notice she did had a fair bit of cleavage line above he hadnt really noticed before but she was quite well developed. He took his eyes away but Kelly seemed to smile at the brief attention he had given as she replied  
  
“I would”  
  
James felt a little uncomfortable was that a definite flirt again?  
  
“and your weekend how did that go”  
  
“Oh ok I guess I dumped Richard tonight though”  
  
“Wasnt it working out? or have you got a new man on the scene?”  
  
“He’s just well immature Im into older guys and yes Ive got my eye on a new man but just need to work on it a little”  
  
James smiled “Glad your ok about things Im gonna crash Ive got Uni first thing”  
  
“Yeh , and Im sitting exams lucky me”  
  
He started to walk out and looked back   
  
“anything I can help with? Im no maths wiz but …”  
  
“Biology “ she smiled “You could probably teach me a few lessons”  
  
James gave a smile and closed the door thinking was it his imagination that  she was throwing out some major vibes his way. He let his mind wander for a second and then checked himself , “she’s just girl” he muttered “not a woman” despite what the surprising glimpse of her body said.  
  
The next day he went to the University it was a pretty normal day  except for the afternoon.  James was a  bit of a star in  the basket ball team and they had practice that day but he couldn’t shoot a basket all practice his co-ordination or something was off  he couldn’t put his finger on it but he new his performance  sucked and his team mates seemed a little shocked by this to. His  coach sat beside him on the bench as James sat off court whilst the others continued to practice.  
  
“James what’s got into you today that’s eight straight  opportunities in a row you’ve missed I have never seen you play so  bad?”  
  
“Coach I haven’t a clue I just don’t seem to be able to get it  together today”  
  
“Look James about next weeks match I think in the light of today perhaps you  should sit  that one out until you  get  back on form Im sorry to do this to you but todays not particularly inspiring and theres some others who are desperate for a  slot and well…”  
  
“I understand Coach , I was pretty lame out there and I don’t  blame you Im gonna hit  the showers “  
  
Dejected James who normally set the pace on the Basketball court walked off shaking  his  head and showered. Walking back home he could see no reason why his performance was so bad he felt normal enough , he wasn’t ill but he was so far  off the mark he  felt an embarrassment to the team. He walked in the house slinging down his sports bag and saw Melinda walking through the  hall to the living  room with a cup of tea.  
  
“Hey  James your  early back isn’t it practice tonight ?”  
”Yeh” he said with  a browned off tone” and I need it”  
  
“Fancy a  cuppa?”  
  
“No Im in the mood for something a little stronger Ill neck back one of the beers you bought me I need it”  
  
He walked in the kitchen to apply some alcohol to ease his mind and relax and reached up for the beers when he  noticed very oddly his fingers only just managed to clip the edge of one of the bottles and he sent it  spinning off the shelf and crashing  to the tiled floor.  
  
“damm!”  
  
He cussed  and  Melinda came in to see the mess of  broken glass at  his feet.  
  
“James are you  ok ?”   
  
“Im fine, Ive no idea what happened there I went to reach one of the beers and didn’t quite get hold of it , what a waste”  
  
“Hey don’t worry Ill help you clear it up”  
  
They both tended to the shattered glass and mopped the beer off the tiles , James paused as they finished and looked back to the shelf it was higher than he recalled and when he reached for another of the beers he found he had to elevate fully on his tiptoes.  
  
“strange” he muttered  
  
“sorry did you say something”  
  
“nothing” James wandered off to the living room and switched on the soccer and sipped his beer down and tried to relax. As he stretched across the sofa his eyes fixed to the match when two very shapely  legs walked directly infront of the tv set disturbing his view more than  pleasantly.   
  
“Hey  James like the outfit ?”  
  
It was Kelly and she looked stunning! She was wore a very tight black dress that simply clung to her curves advertising them. This short dress exposed her fine pins right  down to her black heels and as James looked at her face her hair was up and formed into a very mature yet sexy style combined with some  very subtle  makeup she definitely wasn’t the “little girl” he had labelled her in  his mind before this was a woman a very beautiful woman and he hadnt noticed until now.  
  
“wow”  
  
James let the word fall out of his slight gawping expression and this sent an instant smile to Kelly’s face realising he had appreciated her efforts.  
  
“thanks, you see I can look older if I want to.” She twirled around  and James wasn’t disappointed from any angle.   
”Im out with Tara to a very expensive  restaurant in town she won some tickets in a prize draw”  
  
“You look very um..”  
  
Kelly waited for him to finish smiling a full set of white perfect teeth at him.  
  
“…very nice”  
  
“Nice?” Kelly’s faced  dropped a little “I was kinda hoping for hot..”  
  
Melinda walked in at that  moment.  
  
“Darling you look beautiful a million dollars , doesn’t she James?”  
  
“err yeh I was just saying so”  
  
James turned his attention  away from admiring Kelly and back to the game as Melinda fussed with her daughters hair just tidying some loose strands out of the way.  
  
Later that evening James was still downstairs and Melinda had gone to bed early , he flicked around the channels  not really finding anything that grabbed his attention , his mind felt distracted he found that he kept picturing Kelly and how gorgeous she looked earlier he knew that he was beginning to like her a lot and didn’t know quite how to  feel about that. It was at that point in time he heard a car pull up outside , he pulled back the curtains and saw Tara almost man handling Kelly up the driveway  as presumably her mother waited for them in the idling vehicle.  
  
Tara was also a very pretty teenager she had long shoulder length dark  hair and was very  tall and athletic looking, James went to the door eager to not let Melinda be woken by Kelly’s arrival incase she would get into trouble, the house was pretty large and Melinda slept in his fathers room to the rear and on the 3rd floor so she shouldn’t have noted the car engine.  
  
As he opened the door Tara propped Kelly leaning on her side upon one of the columns that supported the grand porch overhang at the base of the steps.  
  
“Hi ya James , sorry she’s in such a mess the wine was free tonight and well…” Tara just grinned and walked off leaving James to  command the situation. He stepped  down to Kelly and she recognised him with her drunken gaze. Her arm instantly shot out for him to support her.  
  
“mmm fancy  meeting you  here” she began “I should come here more often” she was babbling under the influence and James held and arm around her back and supported her. He almost had to drag her not so slight seeming frame up the steps and into the Living  room.  
  
“Come on stand up Kelly let me take you coat off”  
  
“I bet you say that to all the girls” she grinned and tried to put weight to her feet. When she did so James slipped her full length coat from her shoulders and as he was doing so he paused for a second ,  did she seem tall tonight?”  
  
He glanced down at her black high heels and guess they looked pretty significant but he was a little taken aback that he couldn’t see over her head as normal but then her hair was styled high he thought  and passed this off. He assisted Kelly to  the sofa and she slumped into it pulling him down on her accidentally.   
  
“ooh James you naughty boy” she slurred and he gracefully pulled himself up even though it did feel a little arousing to be so close to her but he had to get her to bed and out the way  of  Melinda or else she would be in trouble for drinking to excess.  
  
He managed to get a cup of strong coffee down her whilst she told him how she fancied him and then she pretty much either passed out or fell to sleep either way she was out  for the count. James struggled with the beauty up the large staircase to her room and managed to  lay  her on the bed and just before he covered her body up still dressed he glanced at her one last  time she was indeed a very beautiful girl, no woman he thought and he laid the blanket down.   
  
Next day James hit the breakfast  table early and missed seeing Kelly , Melinda was up and readying herself for work she was a legal secretary and he must admit as he stole a few glances at her from the breakfast table as she stooped over to polish her shoes she looked very attractive in her smart office attire , he could see what had caught his dads eye. James walked his plates over to the sink and had to grab his boxers which  was all he was wearing as the elastic  seemed to have  given and they threatened to  slip down. Melinda hadnt noticed and buffed up her shoes. James stood at the sink one hand on his waist band and put the plate in the water.   
  
“James I haven’t got any ladders in the back of my tights have I?” Melinda questioned and he turned to show her back to him  so he could see her legs. James walked up to her and looked down she was wearing some very sheer tan tights and they hadn’t a flaw on them.  
  
“no there perfect”  
  
But there was something unusual about Melinda this morning he couldn’t put his finger on it until she turned to face him and pecked him on the cheek.  
  
“thanks sweetie” she smiled and strode off and out to work with the click clacking of her heels as she walked away.  
  
James couldn’t believe it she kissed his cheek which was pretty normal now and then but she didn’t raise herself on her tip toes and he didn’t lean down?  
  
How high were those heels? What was with these two women in this house did they suddenly start wearing huge heels?  
  
James wandered upstairs in deep thought and started to get dressed. He changed his boxers for some briefs but they too seemed baggy. Fearing he was loosing weight he wrapped a  towel around himself and headed to bathroom scales. He was stone or more lighter! His muscle tone seemed normal enough he didn’t  look skinny yet he had lost considerable weight?  
  
Back to his room and he tossed some shorts on which he hadnt worn yet this summer but they seemed baggy like his other clothes , at  least the baggy look was in he reassured himself and pulled an equally loose and long t-shirt on and slipped on his trainers.  
  
“No way!”  
  
James said out loud and spun the training  shoes around in his hand as if verifying  they belonged to him , they  didn’t fit his toes seemed to have plenty of breathing space and that wasn’t normal at all.   
  
“what the hell is going on here, a practical joke?”  
  
He could tell the trainers had to be his as he recalled how he burnt a patch to the right hand side of one of them against his friends bike exhaust melting the sole a touch. He slipped on his sports sandals which seemed to fit and he stepped out of his room as he saw Kelly going downstairs she wasn’t dressed for school and was wearing just a long t-shirt and little else her hair in a total mess.  
  
When he went downstairs Kelly was at the breakfast table drinking some orange juice.  
  
“morning Kelly” he cheerfully greeted and could see she was hung over “not going to school today?”  
  
“oh hi James” she managed a smile “I didn’t want you to see me like this I thought you had gone already”  
  
“feeling rough eh ? You had a skin full last night”  
  
He stood against the fridge and chatted.  
  
“Im so stupid I had two bottles of red last night and I don’t recall much  else”  
  
Still groggy Kelly got  to her feet and made her way across to James.  
  
“But I do remember you looking after me vaguely and you must have got me to my room”  
  
As she walked close by heading for the door James could see she did seem taller somehow not much but it was noticeable he glanced to see no shoes on her feet and made his way to follow her as he simply had to compare his height even though he  had a feeling he wouldn’t like what met his eyes. Kelly however slumped with her hand on her head to the sofa and groaned a little so he didn’t get  the chance.  
  
“Ill owe you one for taking care for me James”  she managed before turning around in discomfort and stretching out on the sofa.   
  
That day at University James had a few lectures but he knew something was up , everyone looked different to him just enough to notice but definitely taller he knew as crazy as his mind told him it  was, he was shorter somehow? What  really  sealed it was his friend Alicia who he knew was 5ft 9 inches tall as he helped her fake an ID a few years back when they  tried to get into some clubs. He was queuing up for some lunch and he saw Alicia before him she hadnt seem him but he recognised her distinctive red hair. Just as he was going to tap her on the shoulder he noticed she was taller than he was!  
  
James looked straight at the back of her red hair he looked down and she had slight heels on maybe one inch but he was a good few inches shorter than her? Without alerting her to his presence James left the Uni for home at Midday he had to suss this all out was he going mad?  
  
He got home and all seemed quite he then heard some splashing from the indoor pool down the hall and poked his head around the door. Kelly was swimming she caught sight of him and offered “ come on in the waters great”  
  
“Guess your feeling better now then?” he remarked and stepped in the room Kelly always did like to swim but James had never really seen her in the home pool as she usually used it at weekends usually when he was out.  
  
“Like a new woman” she smiled as she swam across to the edge by James.  
  
James had to satisfy his curiosity some how. “Your back early?” Kelly questioned.  
  
“Im not quite myself today Kelly listen do I look alright to you?”  
  
Kelly gave him a strange glance and smiled she then began to climb the ladder out of the pool.   
  
James’s eyes nearly fell out on stalks Kelly was wearing a red bikini and she looked sensational. Her figure was as perfect as he had imagined but he didn’t know she was such a well proportioned girl , her bust was considerable. How could he a declared breast man not have noticed how big she was before now and all of it natural. Kelly saw him checking her out as she stepped onto the tiled surround and she purposely flicked her long wet locks in a sexy manor behind her head.   
  
“Pass me my towel please James” she beamed at him and James just continued to stare a little trance like at her gorgeous frame. “my towel?”  
  
“Oh err sure no problem” he kicked back into life feeling a bit conscious about his long appreciation of her.  
  
“geez she is hot!” his brain was applauding this vision before him as she covered her charms with a towel around her.  
  
“You look good to me James as normal very good” she grinned with a coy expression.  
  
“So nothing unusual then?”  
  
Kelly walked up to him and James could see she was taller than before , he was wearing perhaps a half inch sole on his sports sandals and she was in bare feet yet he couldn’t see over her head at all. Kelly looked him up and down and shook her head.  
  
“nope as I said you look as good as always James”she grinned again.  
  
“Kelly Im serious something’s changed about me but I just don’t believe it”  
  
She could sense he was worried in his words and Kelly dried off following him into the living room.   
  
“Come on James you can tell me whats the matter ?”  
  
“This is gonna sound ridiculous”  
  
Kelly sat beside him and put a hand on his knee in a comforting gesture.  
  
“go on?”  
  
“Kelly how tall are you?”  
  
“Me? Why? Im 5foot 5 but I might still be growing,  if Im lucky I might be five six by the end of the year”   
  
“really then it must be true” he said a little glumly  
  
“what must James your not making any sense”  
  
“Kelly your gonna think Im mad but I think Im shorter than I used to be”  
  
She laughed “youre such a kidder you had me going then” her elbow playfully dug into his ribs  
  
but James didn’t laugh back.  
  
“Kelly Im deadly serious I think im shorter than I used to be for real”  
  
“Your not kidding are you , don’t be daft James you are as tall as you are period your height doesn’t change until you get old and you know your spine curves or something”  
  
“But everyone seems taller , you look taller to me”  
  
“ I do?” Kelly smiled “that’s not such a bad thing now is it unless you don’t like girls with long legs”  
  
“Of course I do but I used to look down on you and now”  
  
“Now what?”  
  
Kelly looked into his concerned eyes and took his hand   
  
“Come on stand up silly” she instructed and forced James to stand before her. As he did so inches away from her James could see he was around 3 inches taller than her. Her eyes looking at his nose level.  
  
“See your taller than me as normal”  
  
“your wrong Kelly I can normally  see clean over your head and look  a me”  
  
“Listen James I don’t know why your feeling  insecure you’re a very good looking guy all my friends fancy you like mad and well I …” Kelly decided not to finish her sentence but James didn’t really pay attention to it.   
  
“Im six foot tall so I should be up here” he motioned a hand above Kelly head  
  
“Impossible don’t be silly James your about 5 foot 8 or 9 or something that’s ok”  
  
“No Kelly you really don’t get It ive always been 6ft since I was well fifteen Im in the basket ball team or at least I was”  
  
“Come on James lets settle this”  
  
Kelly dragged his hand and James followed into the study and found a tape measure she held it against the wall and marked very gently on the wall with a pencil 6ft , 5ft10 and 5 ft 8 and finally her height of 5 foot 5.  
  
“Go on let me measure you”  
  
James reluctantly pressed his back to the wall under the marks and Kelly looked up.  
  
“5ft 8 see I was about right”  
  
James turned and looked up at the mark at the six foot level  
  
“then its true”  
  
“Hey cheat you’ve got your sandals on” she grinned and James stepped out of his footwear and Kelly remarked.  
  
“5ft 7 or there abouts, you know I must admit I always thought you towered over me but we arent that different after all”  
  
“5ft 7 do you know what that means?”  
  
Kelly smiled “Its means you would look up to my mate Tara she’s 5 foot 11”  
  
“No Ive lost 5 inches in height that’s impossible”  
  
He marched out of the room and sat with his hands in his face on the sofa. Kelly sat beside him once more  
  
“You know I have never seen you like this James your normally so carefree Im sure your as tall as you’ve always been people just don’t get shorter its like you said impossible besides height doesn’t matter im not exactly a model size myself and Im not complaining”  
  
“But Alicia at Uni she’s taller than me”  
  
“Alicia , oh shes the red head who goes out with Graham Wise inst she? so what does that matter there are probably quite a few girls taller than you that I know”  
  
“Yes but I was taller than her before I know that for a  fact we grew up together”  
  
“You must be mistaken James , don’t you like tall women or something?”  
  
James looked at her sweet face she was trying to be understanding but he must have sounded crazy.  
  
“Sure Kelly I love tall women perhaps better than short ones but Ive never really met that many taller than me since puberty”  
  
“There you said it yourself you prefer tall women so what’s your hang up? Idd like to be a bit taller myself but you get what you are given”  
  
“Look thanks Kelly I think Im just having a bad day feeling a  bit self conscious that all”  James palmed things off and went to his room and listened to some music hoping he could shut the world out for now as it all seemed so unreal. A few hours later and Kelly knocked on his door  
  
“James , Mums’s gonna be back from work soon how about we split before she gets in and go for a drink at the Lions Head im sure you could use one”  
  
James felt a little refreshed from listening to his favourite album and decided he  would try  and forget this  impossible dream he seemed to be having and get on with things.   
  
“Why not” he shouted and he went to the door , it might be fun he thought and opened the door to see Kelly in a very sexy little outfit. She was wearing a very short pair of faded cut off Jean shorts and her very firm midrift was exposed. He could easily see her belly button and she had a bright red crop top on that was so tight her chest seemed larger than before as it defiantly pushed out shouting for visual attention. Her long blonde hair was down he liked it that way and she looked like a real “babe” as James and his mates would say when evaluating women in a club.  
  
James smiled at her and watched her walk before him with her pert rear end wiggling he longed to reach out and pinch it but restrained himself , looking at her now and over the past few days he had never truly noticed how gorgeous this girl was living right under his own roof. As they walked out the door and down the porch steps Kelly laughed “Hang on I nearly went our bare foot!”  
  
James turned to watch her reach down to grab some suede black knee boots tucked inside the porch and she slipped them on. “There that’s better” she smiled and she walked down the steps to James. It was then at that moment that he saw her looking him in the eye. Kelly noticed this at the same time and produced a wide smile. “Wow Im as tall as you are in these”  
  
“Kelly Ive never seen you actually look me straight in the eyes I normally look down on you”  
  
“Give over James that was your imagination, but I am just the right size for you in these if you wanted to kiss me” she flirted and offered him an exaggerated pair of puckered lips and she giggled putting her arm in his as they walked to the pub. James became accustomed to her new seeming size by the end of the evening and infact rather liked seeing Kelly as tall as himself her legs seemed appreciably longer which he found himself drawn to whenever he strayed from her fantastic chest that always grabbed his focus when she moved. Kelly and James got on like a house on fire laughing and joking and he soon forgot his size dilemma. As they walked home that evening Kelly wasn’t drunk but had knocked back a few alcho pops and she stopped James as they walked past the park and turned to him. Her big blue eyes with her long lashes stared deep into his as she came very close to his face. “ James Ive really enjoyed myself tonight and ive had a few drinks which has given me the courage to just ask you this one question, do you fancy me James?”  
  
Her directness was a little breathtaking and he hadnt seen this coming , “Kelly you live with me..”  
  
“Please James “ she grabbed his hand in hers linking her fingers into his “do you find me attractive Ive got to know?”  
  
“Yes” came the simple response and Kelly move in and their lips met for the first time. James felt her firm body press into his with her large chest resting against his own and he was beginning to get aroused just from her proximity. She seemed not only taller but older somehow and definitely sexier his hand rested on her waist and he kissed her back.  
  
Kelly broke their lips and smiled happily “Ive wanted to do that ever since I met you” she kissed him again and then they walked on hand in hand “Ive waited for the moment that you would finally notice me”  
  
“Your gorgeous Kelly “ he began to her delight when they heard a voice from across the road.  
  
“Yo Kelly!”  
  
It was Tara she walked across the road dressed in a silver top and black leather trousers obviously  on her way out.   
  
“Tara” Kelly acknowledged and James witness his first amazon close up. Tara was looking very attractive her long brunette hair was down and her make up immaculately applied to bring out her green eyes. She was wearing some platform shoes and she looked towering. James smiled uneasily as she stood before them and he saw that she was almost a full head taller than he was.  
  
“Hi …” she looked puzzled “ James ??” “ Hi Tara hows it going” “Great thanks are you two on your way out care to join me and Dizzy at the Lantern?”  
  
“No thanks mate Ive got some revising to do but perhaps we can hit the town on Friday James knows a great new club Crackers and well maybe we could all go there?”  
  
James nodded approval still a  little overwhelmed by the stature of Tara.  
  
“Ok I have to run im late see ya later” she smiled and whispered to Kelly “Go girl im jealous” as she walked off. They got back to the house and James remarked to Kelly on Tara’s height.   
  
“You know Im must be shorter because your friend back there I had to look up to her”  
  
“Tara’s tall I told you and she loves heels when she’s in partying mood, are you feeling conscious again about your height”  
  
Her hand came to his shoulder in a comforting manor.  
  
“I don’t know Kelly Im just not convinced Ive always been this short as impossible as that sounds”  
  
“Do you find Tara attractive? I mean as tall as she is?”   
  
“She is pretty” James admitted “and well I guess she does carry off her height well”  
  
“I always feel like a short arse around her , her legs get her noticed all the time”   
  
“You may be shorter Kelly but you’re a lot more attractive besides I prefer blonds and especially ones with…” he didn’t get chance to finish when Melinda saw them gassing in the hallway.   
  
“Sneaked off to the pub eh? Where was my invite you two? “ she smiled and Kelly chatted for a few seconds and walked off upstairs saying good night as she had revising to do before she turned in for the night.  
  
“She seems in a good mood James she’s was practically smiling like the Cheshire cat”  
  
“Guess she has cheered up about dumping her man”   
  
“Ive Seen that look on her face before she’s in love again” Melinda walked off into the living room and James joined her to sit and watch the tv. How about one of those beers of yours James could I try one?”  
  
“Why not” he said “ Ill get you one and a glass”  
  
James kicked off his sandals they seemed to be very uncomfortable and he went to retrieve a beer. This time the shelf was definitely beyond his reach more so than the night previous when he smashed one of the beers.   
  
“Im not imagining this that shelf is either a lot higher or im shrinking” he muttered  
  
The word shrinking sent chills down his spine to admit but the shelf was way out of his reach without a chair. He had never used a chair to reach a shelf or cupboard it was like his first real signal that he wasn’t tall anymore he was short. The word short wasn’t something he like in a description of himself how could he a star of the basket ball team be labelled short and why hadnt anyone really noticed or was that why Tara gave him that strange look earlier had she figured something was odd about him?   
  
He looked at his shorts they seemed baggier his t-shirt that bit longer down his body his arms filling the short sleeves less than before there was no denying it. James grabbed a chair from the kitchen table and slid it over and reached two beers down.   
  
“James actually Ill have a ….oh” Melinda walked in much to the embarrassment of James.  
  
“What are you doing on that chair?”  
  
“I need it to reach the beers Melinda”  
  
“Don’t be ridiculous you put them up there I saw you”  
  
James stepped down and noticed he was only a few inches taller than Melinda.   
  
“James, what’s going on? You look different , your shorter than you used to be a lot shorter?”  
  
“Then you can see it? Oh god im not going mad Melinda Im not sure whats happening to me”  
  
They both walked into the living room and James poured out to Melinda what he had experienced.  
  
“Its amazing but you are definitely shorter I think you should go and see a doctor in the morning they will be as astonished as I am but perhaps they can get you to see a specialist of some sort”  
  
“Specialist, oh geez they’ll think im some sort of freak I mean people don’t just get shorter do they this is something weird they’ll send me for all sorts of horrible examinations and stuff”  
  
His mind reeled with the possibilities “Some one will catch on and the media will be all over me , no I don’t want all that I might yet change this could be temporary couldn’t it?”  
  
“I didn’t think of it like that you may be right perhaps you should take a few days to think about it James meantime your not ill or feeling strange in any way are you?”  
  
“No im fine , perfectly healthy just shorter”  
  
“Then a few days wont hurt, Ill call the Uni for you if you like and tell them your not well and liable to be off for a few days”  
  
“Yeh I guess I cant fool my friends and Its pretty obvious now I mean you noticed didn’t you straight away”  
  
Melinda smiled “you used to look down on me James and well you’re not much taller than me now, its pretty plain to see. Lets see how you are tomorrow eh”  
  
They chatted some more and Melinda retired to bed leaving James pondering on the question of what if things didn’t change?  
  
That night he walked into the study and examined the marks Kelly had made and especially noticed the one that represented her height , marking himself off he was stunned to see another 2 inches had dwindled away he realised he was Kelly’s height now!   
  
James slept little that night dreaming about doctors and press pointing cameras at him wherever he went, when it was morning he realised he had over slept but then it dawned on him that he wouldn’t be attending University today. He jumped out of bed to see how the world looked, he didn’t feel any taller or shorter than last night and was relieved for that small mercy and began to find some clothes out. That was a challenge everything in his wardrobe looked like it belonged to his big brother if he had one and nothing felt right. He ended up opting for some ¾ length trousers which now looked like regular trousers on him not the way fashion intended but with a belt he managed to secure them , as for a top he found his tightest t-shirt the one he used to wear when  exercising to show off his chiselled physique as it clung to his form, but his new body made it seem baggy and loose. As he was pottering around the house he dispensed with even looking for footwear and made himself breakfast. He felt relief today that atleast  Melinda had verified his plight and he knew that Kelly would soon realise when she returned from school and they actually  could look eye to eye for real. Then he heard some one coming downstairs ? Glancing at the clock it was past 8.45 so someone was late. “Kelly? Melinda?” he called. “Its only me” Melinda answered as she came into the kitchen to see him sat at the table eating.  
  
“Arent you late?” James questioned “Oh yeh well a little, ive got a group photo to be in today for some publicity at work and couldn’t decide what to wear a suit or a dress”  
  
“So the dress won” He noted looking at the short blue summer dress she had on “You like?” Melinda asked twirling around for his comment. “It suits you” he offered thinking she did look very good indeed. “But do I wear my new heels or my old court shoes?”  
  
James didn’t offer feedback and watched her slip in and out of two blue pairs of shoes comparing them as women often do.   
  
“Oh I nearly forgot James here I  am worried what shoes to match my outfit and I didn’t recall your dilemma , how are you today?”  
  
“I feel fine I don’t think Im any shorter today maybe its stabilised” he assured himself.  
  
“Good” she smiled and briefly walked out to the hallway mirror. James went to the fridge to grab a cold orange juice and instantly noticed how he was no longer able to look over the fridge as he once did before. Leaning into it he called out to Melinda  
  
“I guess when I do get better I will at least have known what its like to be short like you girls for a while and have seen the world the way you two do . It will certainly make me appreciate 6 foot a lot more!”  
  
“James” he heard Melinda directly behind him as she replied  “erm I don’t think you will be referring to us as short for much longer..”  
  
He fiddled with the orange dispenser and his glass and muttered.  
  
“No offence Melinda you know what I mean your 5 foot 3 and Kelly is 5 foot 5 it’s a different world in these 5 ft something realms”  
  
“James , you might not be in those realms with me and Kelly anymore”  
  
Her words made him suddenly alert and he turned around to see Melinda’s neck!   
  
“What the?…”  
  
Melinda looked down at him she was a complete head taller than James and he was shocked.  
  
“yyoure taller than me?”  
  
“James! I think you must have shrunk again last night”  
  
James looked her up and down and noticed her shoes.  
  
“Oh thank god your wearing the heels” he sighed a little.  
  
“These are the court shoes James , I decided to ditch the heels”   
  
Melinda stepped back and then out of her shoes lowering a fraction so he was looking at her chin level.  
  
“I  am taller than you its incredible!”  
  
“You  look like 6ft 6 to me? Not five foot 3…this cant be happening”  
  
Melinda placed her hands on his shoulders in a comforting manor although it made James feel even shorter as she did so , Melinda looked tall to him she was tall and he couldn’t get over that simple fact as his mind kept saying she’s only 5 foot 3 , she isn’t tall.  
  
They sat in the living room and Melinda chatted with him some more making herself even later for work.  
  
“James , I suggest you just stay in doors today and when I  come back later perhaps we can figure this out eh?”   
  
“Thanks Melinda I  guess I have no choice”  
  
Melinda went off to work leaving James a little down in the mouth as he tried to get a grip on the reality of being …well he didn’t actually know how tall he was now except based on the difference to Melinda he was below 5ft for sure. James decided to work of his frustrations in the pool and went swimming his swim shorts didn’t fit but no one was around so he went naked. The water was fine and inviting and he soon chilled out swimming a few lengths. When he had had enough he swam to the ladder where he had left his towel about to get out when he noticed it was missing. He looked about from the water and didn’t see it and then heard a stifled giggling from the doorway.   
  
“Kelly?”  
  
He could tell the laugh in an instant and she burst into the room. “got ya lover boy, if you want your towel your have to come and get it” she teased. He looked at her by the side of the pool dressed in her school uniform he hadnt realised it  was lunch time already and she would be home.  
  
Part of him was pleased to see her last night was the beginning of something new between them but then last night he was taller than her and he just began to think how much taller she might be to him now he couldn’t get out that would be far to embarrassing.  
  
“Come on  Kelly give me my towel”  
  
“Come and get it hot buns , you know if I  knew my new man was swimming in his birthday suit I wouldn’t have gone to school today and speaking of which why arent you in Uni?”  
  
James hugged to the side of the pool so his manhood wasn’t on display he guessed as he was doing breast stroke she only managed to catch a glimpse of his bare butt but he felt very self conscious.   
  
“I didn’t go to day , listen Kelly what I said yesterday”  
  
“What that Im gorgeous” she smiled and walked up close to the pool edge squatting down to speak with him. She saw his face was a touch serious.  
  
“You don’t regret last night do you I mean you still do like me…”  
  
She began concerned his opinions may have altered over night   
  
“No , I mean yes I still fancy you more than ever Kelly but erm things are a bit different than yesterday”  
  
“Like what?” she played with a strand of her long blond hair twirling it waiting for his answer.  
  
“Me , Im different Im not the same guy you kissed Im…”  
  
Kelly huffed and put the towel down on the floor and stood up.  
  
“Oh I get it, you think Im too young for you don’t you , well im nearly seventeen James I think you need to grow up a little and not play with  my feelings”  
  
Before James could say anything she walked off clearly upset feeling he was about to build up to a rejection that she didn’t want to hear.  
  
James pulled himself from the pool and dried off he wrapped the towel around his waist covering his manhood and walked after her. Kelly was upstairs in her bedroom the door shut.  
  
“Kelly?” he called from outside the door “Kelly open up you jumped to the wrong conclusion babe”  
  
“Can it James, I know when the lets just be friends line is about to come out”  
  
“Kelly open the door you really don’t understand its not you its me”  
  
“Yeh decided you want a woman and not a girl I know”  
  
“That’s not it Kelly , you are a woman you’ve made me notice that and you’re the hottest babe Ive ever known  but Ive changed and you may not like it”  
  
“James don’t tease me , you tell me im the hottest babe you know and now you’ve changed what into a typical man who just enjoys the chase?”  
  
James shook his head facing the white door to her room and decided what the hell he would come out with it and face her reaction.  
  
“No Ive become a short arse who’s smaller than his gorgeous girlfriend and afraid she wont like him anymore…”  
  
There was some silence “James what are you on about?”  
  
“Kelly I tried to explain to you yesterday Im shrinking”  
  
Suddenly the door pulled back and James saw the breathtaking view of Kelly a tall towering Kelly with long legs. He was shorter than her by far as he looked forward all he could see was her imposing chest looking back at him as her tight school blouse struggled to contain her wonderful full curves. Kelly looked straight over his head and into the hall. “James?”  
  
“Down here blondy” he tried to smile awkwardly as his now very tall girlfriend looked down not believing what met her eyes.  
  
“Oh my god James what , what happened to you? Your so short! I , I tower over you?”  
  
“That’s what I was trying to tell you Kelly ive turned into a midget im shrinking”  
  
“Yesterday you weren’t kidding , look at you , you are so short!”  
  
James went to turn away and back to his bedroom. “hey”  
  
Kelly called and her hand grabbed his shoulder stopping him “don’t go James”  
  
He turned to face her once more and had to look up over her chest into her big blue eyes.  
  
“Man, Kelly you are so tall if I didn’t know you I would swear you were seven feet tall”  
  
Kelly smiled at his description of her “seven foot tall is that how big I seem to you?”  
  
“You look taller than Tim Towers to me Kelly its hard to take in”  
  
Tim Towers was the nick name of one of James’s friends in the basket ball team who also played for the district and gained his title due  to his size twelve  feet and 6 foot 11 inch frame.  
  
“I do?” Kelly looked down at  James he did seem extremely short to her as small as her little eight year old cousin but she actually  liked looking down at him like this it made her feel sexy some how and seeing  his bare rippling muscles she liked what she saw despite his size he was so well formed.  
  
“Then you don’t like tall girls James yesterday you said you did”  
  
James looked at her long  legs and smooth thighs that came out of her very short black school skirt , they seemed thicker and stronger looking but more attractive if that was possible than before infact Kelly seemed like a whole new woman taller more dominant , imposing and absolutely sexy James felt himself a little aroused by her closeness especially faced with her firm chest and the considerable cleavage that he couldn’t help glimpse due to her top two buttons being open so innocently before him.   
  
“Kelly I love tall girls and you  look”  
  
“What?” she grinned looking  down at him.  
  
“You look awesome like this so very tall”  
  
“Thanks baby” Kelly beamed and hugged him to her and James was crushed up against that tall body with his face finding a soft embrace from her bosoms beneath her clothes. Kelly let him go after a couple of seconds and laughed a little as James was flushed bright red in the face.  
  
“Sorry babe I didn’t realise just how tall I am they kinda look you in the eye now don’t they”  
  
“Im not complaining” James smiled up and felt his growing arousal at just how hot this towering babe was at this size.  
  
“James Im not sure whats happening to you but I am your girlfriend whatever ok?”  
  
“Then you don’t think im a freak?”  
  
“I think you look handsome however tall you are and your no freak just a little short which makes me feel really tall and I kinda like this feeling”  
  
They sat down on her bed as she let him in her room. “You must be like 4 foot something tall James?”  
  
“I guess looking at you, it scares the hell out of me , Melinda confirmed I was shrinking yesterday when I”  
  
“Mum”  
  
Kelly sat next to him and he noticed how extremely long her legs stretched out compared to his own.   
  
“This is my mums faults she’s done this to you it all makes sense to me now”  
  
James gave a blank look “ Im sorry what are you saying”  
  
Kelly half smiled and looked down into his eyes. “James remember I told you not to upset mum a while back and what she said to you that night?”  
  
James thought hard “Melinda , no I don’t see what you saying”  
  
“When you fell out with mum you said that she threatened to make you look up to her and to cut you down to size so you would respect her”  
  
“But that’s ridiculous Kelly she cant…”  
Kelly interrupted “James come with me to the attic a minute”  
  
“What ?”  
  
James was even more confused. “Kelly Im not dressed to go anywhere”  
  
“Ive a bad feeling about this come on James you must come with me”  He decided to follow her and watched her long legs as she climbed the long ladder before them to the attic. In the attic James could see it had been cleaned a little since he had been up there last xmas. Kelly flicked the light on and there was a large wooden floor with several old boxes and an old chair and bureau. Kelly walked to the bureau and opened it up pulling out a thick book which was very old and tatty. She flicked through it and found a page marker.   
  
“I was right mum did do this to you.”  
  
“Kelly im standing in the attic in nothing but a towel and your not making any sense?”  
  
“Come on back to my room Ill explain”  
  
Kelly and James went back to her room and she carried the book. He sat on her bed at the head by the pillows and she pulled up her dressing table chair and sat down.  
  
“Im not sure where to start but you will believe this James because you know and I know shrinking isn’t possible”  
  
“go on?”  
”When I was twelve I went on a little hunt for my Christmas presents in our old attic , mum always keeps this book where she figured I wouldn’t go. But I was young and when she went out shopping I came across this book as I searched and it looked old and interesting. It was then I discovered it’s a book of magic”  
  
James gave a face of total disbelief “Magic”  
  
“James im telling you the truth , think about it your 4 foot something tall that’s not normal is it?”  
  
He had to agree with her however bizarre this all sounded.  
  
“It’s a book of spells real magic spells and in the cover I found a note attached. It was from my grandfather he left her the book when he passed away and said it used to belong to our family many years ago he said it was one of Merlins old books”   
  
“Merlin? You mean Merlin , king Arthur etc? That’s all stories isn’t it?”  
  
“I used to think so but this book is very powerful , I read out one of the spells when I was in the attic in our old place and it worked!”  
  
“Like what?”  
  
“It was a levitation spell I made an old lamp hover in the air I was stunned” I didn’t touch the book for the next few weeks it scared me at that age and I didn’t let mum know what I had learnt.  
  
But every now and then mum uses this book because odd things happened and only I seem to realise she uses it to get the things she wants , she’s not evil James but she’s determined to have things her own way. “  
  
“This is …well Im speechless”  
  
“When I was fifteen James I had really bad flu I was in bed ,raging fever and well absolutely knocked out with it and I came down with it just before we were due to fly away on holiday the next day. Mum comforted me and said I would be better the next day and I was. I woke up the very next day and I felt fabulous not a cold symptom in sight and James Ive never had so much as a cold or illness since mum fixed it”  
  
“She put a spell on you”  
  
“How else do you explain that I simply don’t get ill , I checked out the book one night when she went out and found a spell that makes the recipient forever healthy”  
  
“no way”  
  
James and Kelly chatted as she relayed more and more examples and she summarised them all with a final note “ and to this day I have never let on that I know she uses this magic book and she is obviously out to teach you a lesson in respect to her”  
  
“But she has been so nice to me lately”  
  
“Cunning isn’t she”  
  
James had to believe it all even as unbelievable as it all was he was living  proof.  
  
“Can you reverse this then?”  
  
“I can see the spell she cast on you James but only on grandfathers notes it warned that only the one who casts the spell can break the spell and well I haven’t used magic since the lamp freaked me out”  
  
“Well how short will she make me , what does it say?”  
  
“It’s a teaching spell , mum is the teacher and you are the pupil it sais the pupils will learn respect though size and the size will be determined by the teacher when they chant the closing verse of the spell and confirm the education is complete and the pupil can once again deserve their stature and be worthy of their former self”  
  
“So im doomed until she has humiliated me a little”  
  
“Sorry James I didn’t know until I saw you today, mums gone a little to far with this one but believe me she is harmless she wouldnt hurt you for the world its her way to gain what she wants from you a bit of respect as crazy as it sounds”  
  
“We better destroy that thing before she does other weird stuff “   
  
“no we cant , you would never be returned to normal without this”  
  
“ I guess, but I cant handle being this size look at how puny I am she could stretch this out for a few weeks I might be knee high to you by then”  
  
“I certainly would be a toweringly tall girlfriend to you” Kelly grinned at the thought “come on James its not that bad, think of it this way , you like tall women and now me and mum will be very tall women around you”  
  
“I must admit you do seem …” James stopped wondering if he should continue. “I seem what?”  
Kelly put the book down “well ok you seem sexier some how when Im this tall to you”   
  
“really I like that” Kelly stood up “Is it the long legs that do it for you?”  
  
“Or something else?”  
  
She grinned very sexily and asked him to stand up. James complied and once more was confronted by her incredible body.   
  
“Kiss me James” she softly spoke and for the first time in his life he found himself raising on his tip toes to meet a girls lips but Kelly was no ordinary girl to him she was now almost an amazon in stature by comparison. They kissed for several minutes and James was a little breathless from the session. Unlike yesterday her lips he noticed seemed larger , slightly wider and held against his with a lasting impression.  
  
“Wow Ive never experienced a kiss like that before” He almost sighed in delight and Kelly grinned  
  
“You are a pretty good kisser yourself”  
  
“No I didn’t mean that Kelly , well yeh you kiss great but Ive never had to reach up to kiss a girl before and your lips and tongue…”  
  
“what?” she questioned intrigued and smiling broadly.  
  
“well they seem bigger noticeably bigger than when we kiss like this”  
  
“Really and do you like that?”  
  
“Its sexy so different than when we kissed before”  
  
“Then getting shorter than me for a while might be enjoyable in some aspects eh?”  
  
She smiled and sat back down and James sat  down on the bed once more.   
  
“Well if that was anything to go by it might be very interesting being your boyfriend and being shorter than you”  
  
“Have you ever”  
  
Kelly stopped and flushed a little red  
  
“Go on have I what?”  
  
“Well you seem to like the fact Im taller than you right now but I was wondering if you have ever made love to a taller woman before”  
  
James was taken aback by her question and a little excited by where it could lead.   
  
“No , like I said ive never dated someone taller than myself its all new to me”  
  
Kelly was still a little coloured in her face by the subject of conversation James noticed how innocent she appeared.  
  
“James Ive never made love to a short guy either….I actually kind of like you shorter than me to”  
  
“You do?”  
  
“I don’t feel so intimidated when we are alone” She admitted  
  
“Do I intimidate you Kelly”  
  
“No well, you are a little older than me and well probably a lot more experienced but somehow the fact that Im taller than you “ she paused “ well it makes me feel more confident and that”  
  
James smiled  
  
“You know we could have some sexy fun with this magic book James if you felt like it”  
  
Kelly gave him a playful look which intrigued him .  
  
“What did you have in mind?”  
  
Kelly flicked through some of the old weathered pages and found a spell she was thinking of.  
  
“I noticed when looking for the spell my mother used on you that in the same section there was a lot of other size related spells and this one here it’s a growth spell”  
  
“To enlarge me back to normal? Or make me taller?” James felt a glimmer of hope to reverse the spell he was under at present.  
  
“No, like I said that’s not possible it would be countering what my mothers spell is set to do and I cant do that only she can return your inches back to you but I could grow a little if you would like?”  
  
She smiled as she said the last few words showing it appealed to her and testing his reaction.  
  
“Make yourself even taller?” he thought about it and imagined seeing her rise above him those long legs of hers getting even longer not to mention her other great assets increasing in size to be even more impressive.  
  
“I think you would look even hotter as a six foot babe”  
  
He grinned and waited to see if she dared to chant and cast the spell.   
  
“Ive never done this before but it would be kind of fun wouldn’t it Ive always found 5 foot 5 rather average and a few extra inches would look good on me as you said shall I?”  
James nodded and Kelly muttered some strange words twice and stood up and encouraged him to stand before her.  
  
“Come on James stand close to me so you see the full effect of me growing”  
  
Ever so slowly he watched her chest begin to rise , her cleavage now out of his line of sight as her bust began to rise above his head   
  
“this is awesome I can feel myself getting bigger its like the room and everything around me is getting smaller” she was totally absorbed in the process. James looked down and her skirt waist band was rising to meet him he was surprised her clothes had grown with her. In a few seconds he was waist height to her and then she chanted a word to cease the growth and stood with her head pushed down as she arched over to remain standing in the room. It was no good she had to sit down before she hurt her spine, her legs came out either side on the floor before James each seemingly as tall as he was. James looked on in awe as she rested back on her hands behind her and she smiled pleased with the results.   
  
“I must be 8 or 9feet tall look at the size of me, look at these great big long legs”  
  
Kelly nudged James with a leg that was almost twice the thickness of his own two legs combined and he ran a hand over the smooth long line of her right  leg stopping short of her skirt. Kelly seemed to  fill the room with her incredible body and her size had increased the desire welling within James he had never confronted such a woman.  
  
“I think your legs alone tower over me , these are unreal Kelly”  
  
“I bet Im taller than you sat down” she grinned and sat up straight before James and much as before he was eye level with her chest but this time it looked far more exciting what gently bounced beneath her thin blouse. Her breasts he imagined had to be the size of the basket balls he was used to training with he stared  and wondered what they felt like at that size?   
  
“I told you I would be taller than you sat down” Kelly was evidently pleased at how she easily towered over her short boyfriend.  
  
“You’re an amazon your so huge everything about you is just so much bigger”  
  
He tried not to linger on her bust but who was he kidding at 5 foot 5 they distracted him at probably 9ft tall they couldn’t be missed!  
  
“Come closer James” she beckoned and curled a finger enticing him to stand inches before her.  
  
James stepped forward and he was only just able to keep eye contact looking up and over the curve of her blouse. Kelly’s hands came down and he felt them cup his bottom and one of her now large hands playfully pinched his rear before she ran one hand up his bare back and the other settled on his rear.   
  
“mmm you may be short but your still well defined” she began “such a firm little butt as well”   
  
James couldn’t hold back his enjoyment from her large hands on his body and the towel he was wearing showed his appreciation as the blood flowed to his member and pushed the towel out.  
  
“Oooh James” Kelly smiled and those large hands slid from his rear end and one brushed across the bulge beneath the towel and he sighed heavily. Then her fingers searched for the knot in his towel and teased at it until it broke free and it fell to his feet. There he was little over 4 feet tall with beauty more than twice his height , and now he was completely naked before her. Kelly stared at his manhood and her now long fingers took hold of it stroking his shaft.   
  
“I  bet this is impressive at its real size James” Kelly began to lay back and her body covered a lot of the room length. As her hands let free his member she seductively edged her skirt up her long legs  and  offered James a clear signal to proceed.   
  
“I never thought my first time with you would be like this Kelly” James stood there between  the huge thighs of this tall seductress his eyes gazing at the long sexy legs that were now totally  revealed to him and he felt a little nervous of how he would perform on top this super tall babe.  
  
“James  I need you” she breathed heavily and he could see her hands eagerly pulling down her black silk knickers , he  moved forward and onto his knees between those imposing thighs and his hands took  over  the job of removing her underwear. He shuffled back and pulled the garment free and he could smell her scent upon it. Running his hands slowly following up those legs had almost to climb on top of Kelly. As he let nature guide his direction he entered her as he almost found himself balancing upon her large frame with his face in her stomach area and his legs resting on her own. Kelly was welcoming to his organ and he lost it completely and easily  within her something he had never done so easily  before and it was a something he wouldn’t forget as he  began to make love to her. Despite his reduced length he seemed to be hitting the right note with Kelly and she reached down and clamped two hands on his shoulders as if holding him there. He  felt her increased strength and dominance as she began to buck upwards and drive him deeper into her. He drove himself into her flesh for all he was worth , looking forward he was further aroused by her large chest swaying and jiggling her blouse to their every move and he lost it in unison with Kelly who cried “yes James !”  
  
He slumped on her body for a few seconds as his member throbbed with the ripples of after pleasure and then he climbed off of Kelly. Kelly sat up and flicked her long blonde locks over her shoulders her face flushed red and her big blue eyes sparkling. She began to stand as she was going to make her way to the bathroom and her head bumped the ceiling “Ow!” she grumbled and   
  
then chanted a couple of words he hadnt heard before reverting to her normal size once more.  
  
Even though she was still taller than him somehow she seemed short to him once again and James found himself disappointed seeing her walk off to the bathroom as a regular sized woman.  
  
James picked his towel up and fastened it around him  and sat on the bed waiting for her return he noticed on the carpet below her discarded knickers they hadnt reduced with her perhaps because they remained separate and he picked them up in his hands intrigued by  the size of them.   
  
“Oops I forgot those , a souvenir for your first time with a leggy blonde” Kelly strode back in and sat beside him beaming her perfect white teeth.  
  
“I cant get over how tall , how big you became its so much different to look at a woman and to be close when she’s twice your size”  
  
“did you enjoy how much bigger I was James , I found it very erotic knowing I was kind of in control and feeling  your shorter body pressed to mine it was exciting”  
  
“To be honest Kelly I wish you hadnt made yourself shorter again well so soon I mean”  
  
“Ive been home nearly an hour James and well even if I miss the next  period at school I have to make netball or im toast with my teacher , I  skipped her class last week and she found out and grilled me. I guess it was lucky she didn’t report me to Melinda but I gave her my word I wouldn’t miss class again if she let it go that time. But that doesn’t mean we cant do this again Ive remembered the words for the spell so I can grow for you anytime we are alone” Kelly grinned and James responded to reach up his head to offer a kiss.   
  
“Shame I was hoping to spend the afternoon with you but I understand , anyhow I guess im not gonna need you to grow in a  few days if Melinda keeps this spell up on me”  
  
James watched Kelly gather her school bag throwing  some clothes in and she then combed her long blonde hair before the mirror as he marvelled at her sheer beauty.   
  
“It would be nice to stay here with you James, I wish I didn’t have to leave so soon but I cant afford for Mum to discipline me for truancy I would hate to be grounded just when we are starting  to become an item. It’s a pity you don’t go to my school University  boy, I should put a spell on you to make you my age” she laughed and then turned to James and smirked with a large mischievous pause before she continued “ but perhaps you could come to school with me”  
  
James stared across confused “what are you on about?”  
  
“James you really did like it when I was taller than you didn’t you?”  
  
“Yeh sure I did it was incredible…”  
Kelly interrupted with an excited air in her speech  
  
“well ive an idea how we can be together this afternoon if your game”  
  
“Game for what?”  
  
“for an adventure James , if your brave enough”  
  
“Now you have really lost me an adventure?”  
  
Kelly flicked through the magic book once more and settled on a page.  
  
“Yes this one will do it James”  
  
“do what Kelly your not making sense” James smiled and shook his head a little in confusion to where this conversation was heading.  
  
“James answer me this question honestly do you think you would be frightened if I was a lot taller than you”  
  
He took a second to respond “how do you mean a lot taller than me? Bigger than you grew a moment ago?”  
  
She nodded her head and smiled “ Yes , what if I was a whole lot bigger to you”  
  
“So those pretty legs of yours are twice that size making me what about knee high to you?”  
  
James pondered on that mental image of barely able to imagine how amazing Kelly would be at that scale. Kelly came over to sit by James and continued.  
  
“You like that thought I can tell James but actually I was thinking of the difference in size between us being much larger than that”   
  
Her hand rested on his leg as she looked for his response.  
  
“James would you let me shrink you?”  
  
Alarm bells rang in his mind he hadn’t contemplated being made shorter by Kelly    
  
“shrink me? I err thought you were talking about making yourself bigger than me?”  
  
“Well I would be making myself bigger than you in a way by shrinking you down small, don’t you like the idea James? This way you could come to school with me this afternoon and we could be together”  
  
“Shrinking me but Melinda’s spell I thought you couldn’t alter it?”  
  
“I cant make you bigger James that would  be  reversing her spell but I can make you smaller,  you know temporarily it would be fun”  
  
Kelly smiled a sweet and  innocent smile and her blue eyes begged for his trust and twinkled  with the appeal of this proposition.   
  
“Geez,  your  actually  talking about shrinking me  on purpose to be like really small. Im err just not sure Kelly that’s kind of big decision can I think about it?”  
  
James stepped off the bed and looked around her room and then back at his tall girlfriend who was grinning sat there playing with her long blonde hair as she styled it.  
  
“James , baby Im gonna  be late as it is what’s there to think about? I think it would  be really cool to have a tiny boyfriend for the afternoon and wouldn’t you like see what I look  like  as a giant  woman?”  
  
He had to admit if the last hour was anything to go by it would be more than interesting to experience this as she said herself an adventure but into  a world of giants?  
  
“Kelly , it  might be kind of well…giants  and all everything would seem so big” He couldn’t express his reservations at all well. Kelly stood up and walked over to him and turned him to  face  her as he did so he was again  impressed by her busty frame looming over him her arms slipped tenderly around his  neck and she lowered her face  towards his. “Everything would be big James that’s the whole point and especially me. I would tower over you  like a  giantess….”
