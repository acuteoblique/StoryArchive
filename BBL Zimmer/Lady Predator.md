##Part 1
Jack Steele knew instinctively that something didn’t quite add up with this case but for now the answers he sought eluded him. For over a month he had been investigating the more than curious disappearance of fifteen men throughout the city and as he flicked through their images upon his pc he sighed with frustration. What had he missed? What connected all these men? Comparing their ages they were as young as twenty and as old as thirty five, they all had different professions one was even unemployed so what was the link? They lived in different parts of the city and none of them seemed to be connected or familiar with the other in any conceivable way. He needed a coffee and stood up from his desk frustrated with the progress he was making.  
  
Summer was at the vending machine she was a detective inspector like himself they even partnered once in a while and he valued her as a sounding board in these types of situations.  
“You look like a man in need of a caffeine injection”  
Summer smiled selecting a drink for Jack they often collided at the vending machine so she knew his regular poison.  
“You said it Summer this case has got me beat, for once I admit that I’m completely stumped”  
“This is the case of the thirteen guys that have been reported missing, right?”  
“Make that fifteen now, two extra this week alone”  
“Really? So did you chase down that theory you had early last week regarding the mystery blonde?”  
“Actually there is was something in that, well at least it seemed so at the time. Remember the guy who disappeared last week the taxi driver?”  
Summer nodded recalling the news reports she had seen.  
“Well I found some CCTV footage taken from a camera by the taxi rank and you can make out a tall blonde getting into the back of his cab. Also the case of Tony Markham the guy who went missing from Starlight nightclub, well the bar tender said he noticed a very attractive tall blonde at the bar most of that evening and Tony was talking with her for some time.”  
“Not exactly conclusive evidence that it’s the same woman though is it?”  
“I thought that until I reviewed the video records from Bob Rainer the police officer who vanished two weeks ago. It was the tape from his cars onboard traffic video camera and when he pulls over you can see a glimpse of a tall blonde woman in profile walking around the front of the car”  
“What did she look like?”  
“The image is too grainy the footage was in the late evening so no clues except she’s got a great pair of legs”  
“men”  
Summer laughed.   
“any connection with a blonde this week from the two new guys you mentioned?”  
“Not so far. I’ve yet to interview the co-workers from the last one but I know there isn’t any eye witnesses as such from the initial report because this one sounds a little odd location wise”  
“Sounds like you need help. I’ve been running an investigation on some heavy duty criminal damage which frankly is going the same way so I’ve got some time to kill. Need another set of eyes?”  
“I’d appreciate that Summer you can start by going through the profiles on each of them on my system if you like. Perhaps see if that woman’s intuition of yours can draw a link somewhere”  
  
Summer walked over to Jack’s desk and he followed her, she was a good looking woman in her late twenties with long dark hair and a shapely figure that often compelled Jacks attention to drift a distraction that was quite welcome by him. Summer leaned over his desk and then slid herself into his leather swivel chair and flicked through the multiple case studies as Jack stood behind the chair and leaned over her shoulder trying to avert his eyes from the nice hint of cleavage that was otherwise well covered by Summers formal clothes.  
“Well I can see a connection straight away”  
She smiled glancing back at Jack for a second.  
“These guys are all gorgeous, look at them”  
Jack studied each guy’s photo in turn purely from the physical appearance point of view something he wasn’t naturally inclined to do.  
“Hell your right they are all good looking guys, trust a woman to spot that”  
”Intuition I suppose”  
Summer said smugly.  
“So what does this mean Summer?”  
“I don’t know, could be a co-incidence I suppose, hey Jack you had better watch yourself it could be you next”  
  
That afternoon Jack drove his Jaguar to the construction site down town where the last disappearance was reported. As he pulled up to the site office he met with the site foreman. Having placed their regulation hard hats on they walked into the work area.  
“Yeh, I knew Sean Bordman he was a hard worker kept good hours, never late”  
“So what’s the story here did anyone speak to Sean the day he went missing any of his colleagues?”  
“I’m taking you to see Burt he worked with Sean that day I had them both on cabling”  
They walked into what appeared to be the mere carcass of skyscraper and the site manager ushered Jack into the temporary lift. Jack watched the ground slip away as they ascended in the open lift what must have been sixty floors until the lift stopped and they stepped out onto a concrete and steel girder nightmare that was a building in the early stages.  
  
“There’s Burt and Ian now. Burt this gentleman is Inspector Steele from the Police department he’s investigating about Sean I figured you were the last man to see him on Monday”  
Jack shook the mans hand and then retreated brushing the dust from a stack of concrete blocks in order to sit down on them in his suit. He noticed the sheer drop the other side of the safety rail and decided he didn’t wish to sit any nearer to Burt who was very close to it.  
“So Burt if I may call you Burt, can you recall the last encounter you had with Sean that day”  
“Yeh I can but I don’t understand what happened to him. I was working on this level and Sean was one level above from here working on some conduit. We had just had lunch together played a game of cards and he went to back to work right above us here. I shouted up at him to kill his dam stereo it was driving me nuts , he switched it off and we were chatting for a while shouting up and down to each other when Sean cried out “No way I’m hallucinating” and then I heard him shout “woah!” and then he was gone, just gone!”  
Jack gave the man a steely eyed look.  
“So is there any way down from that level above besides the lift?”  
”No he would have come past me. The lift stops here at present we haven’t got the rig any higher, you have to go up by ladder”  
“And you searched that level?”  
“Nothing to search it’s emptier than this one just a few beams scaffolding a few false walls. He was gone”  
“Spooky it was”  
Another voice piped up it was Ian an Irish man Jack recognised from his accent.  
“I came up to look around with Burt and we found his tool box and his clothes, even his shoes”  
“His clothes?”  
Jack was surprised  
“All of them well except his underwear”  
“Listen gentlemen not that I’m finding this hard to accept but could he have jumped for some reason committed suicide? Landed in the foundations it’s pretty vast down there”  
“No impossible”  
The site foreman stepped in to the conversation.  
“When I was alerted by radio we ran searches just in case. Believe me you would see the remains of body if it fell from this height”  
“Doesn’t make sense, what was Sean’s mood that day?”  
”He was getting married in a week the guy was happy no worries in the world. Inspector he didn’t kill himself he just vanished into thing air like one of those twilight zone episodes”  
Jack didn’t much care for science fiction he worked on facts but nothing made sense with this at all. Having learned little else Jack went down in the lift with the site manager and Ian.   
“No unusual or unauthorised people entered your site that day?”  
Jack tried a final probe but the foreman shook his head.  
“No, afraid not it’s fenced off and very secure. I know who comes and goes”  
  
As Jack walked back to his car shaking the dust from his shoes he noticed one of the workers down below wolf whistling a girl across the street and he walked back to find Ian who was clocking off for the day.  
“Just one last thing you didn’t happen to see a tall blonde hanging around here the day Sean went?”  
“Funny you ask but there was one extremely hot babe that the guys down here were all raving about. If I recall they said she had long blonde hair, blue eyes and was about six foot four. Apparently she gave them all quite a show it was all they talked about for a day or two. I didn’t see her but Billy and Leo did down on the diggers they fell in love that day!”  
  
Jack wandered across to a large yellow JCB and flagged the operator to cut the engine, introducing himself he asked about the woman.  
“Oh man, me and Bill can’t shake her from our minds she was one sexy lass”  
“Can you describe her?”  
“Can I? Oh boy she was a really fit blonde, long legs up to her arm pits a large rack and wearing those itty bitty shorts you know those daisy duke’s. Long blonde hair real natural looking and those dazzling blue eyes”  
The man was almost salivating as he recalled the woman.  
“I’d say she was six foot something easy without the heels and she was just looking up at the building staring and sticking out that huge chest of hers just over there outside the mesh fencing”  
“Did she come in?”  
”No she stood there fixated at something I think she was posing for us. We whistled our approval you know a few encouraging shouts as you do and then this beauty just walked off we didn’t see her again”  
  
  
Jack was driving back home to his flat and called Summer on the way from his mobile phone.  
“That’s really strange Jack and you say that was five minutes before this Sean character went missing?”  
”Yeh according to the eye witnesses I spoke to. But she didn’t enter the site it’s pretty secure so what’s her connection? I am starting to think this blonde is becoming a prime suspect it’s gone beyond coincidence now don’t you agree”  
“Definitely Jack , say where are you at present?”  
Summer discovered Jack was only a couple of miles away and asked if he would swing by on his journey, she had been called out to another case of heavy vandalism it was becoming rife throughout the city.  
  
Stepping out of the car Jack saw that Summer was looking up at the exterior of a building with a perplexed expression across her pretty features.  
“And you think your case is weird”  
She smiled at Jack as he strolled towards her.  
“See that up there?”  
Her face looked skyward again and he followed the same angle of gaze. About a hundred feet up the high rise building its glass exterior upon this one face was badly damaged all the way down its width.  
“Every window upon that floor and along that whole side is cracked and that goes for the floor below it. The glass is buckling inwards not outwards so it’s not consistent with an explosive device. It’s like an implosion? The damage occurred from outside with a force pushing in”  
“A concentrated seismic disturbance beneath the building? Perhaps isolating its effects on the weakest structural side?”  
Jack clutched at the only feasible explanation he could offer.  
“I don’t think so Jack look at the building the other side of this street dead opposite”  
He turned to follow Summers finger as she pointed and laid eyes upon another identical building facing the damaged one yet physically separated by the road. It also exhibited the same damage upon the same two levels.  
“I don’t believe it?”  
“It gets worse”   
Summer began reeling off a list of damage that occurred two nights ago in the area they stood.  
“A mile back up this street the front end of a parked car was compacted, the engine block the lot. Close to this two lamp posts bent backwards at thirty degrees. A shop awning ripped half way off its mountings, a telephone cubicle on its side and a motorcycle looking like a tank had rolled over it. Its like vandals came through here leaving a trail of devastation and not a single witness except for some old tramp I found who insists he saw the back of a car flip up for a second as the front of it simple crunched flat in a second or two. No reason, nothing touched it just as if the car imploded at the front end. Jack I didn’t buy that story”  
“I can see why. Have you called in the team to examine all this”  
”On their way but I’ve got cases of damage to buildings and odd crushed vehicles all over the city”  
“All the same?”  
“No, some cars are just dented in the sides and found a few metres upon the pavement from where they were parked. A few flattened benches a damaged bus stop shelter and the really odd pattern of indentations into a freshly laid tarmac road by the cathedral….shall I continue?”  
“Some sort of organised gang using some crazy machinery of some sort? Hell it sounds like madness.”  
”Your case doesn’t sound so bad now does it Jack?”  
He agreed and pondered in thought for a second.  
”Summer surely you have some witnesses for the other areas where this has happened. Is it all during the night early hours of the morning?”  
“Actually day or night. I interviewed a couple who believe it or not were driving in their car when they bounced off of something they didn’t see in the road and spun around, bright sunlight perfect visibility conditions. The pedestrians who concurred this story saw nothing. Yet and get this Jack they swear someone upon a public address system shouted obscenities at the driver from a distance and a quarter of a mile down the road within ten minutes after that incident a glass shop had all of its lead crystal products come crashing down in the window display. Shop keeper said there was a series of tremors outside like a large train rolled by but again nothing to see!”  
“Freaky”  
Jack said and looked at his watch he wanted to call it a night and hit a bar for a drink to relax, all these crimes would still be there in the morning.  
“Summer care to grab a drink I think we both could use one after today”  
Summer was delighted she was very sweet on Jack, she loved his rugged good looks and athletically toned muscular frame and often she would melt in his brown eyes. The sexual tension between them both remained just that, they never crossed the mixing work with pleasure boundary.   
  
When they arrived at a nearby wine bar Jack got the drinks in whilst Summer excused herself wishing to freshen up her appearance. He sat at the bar and his mind walked through both his case and that of Summers searching for inspiration on either. It was then that he heard the click clack of some heels upon the wooden floor approaching behind him and suddenly he inhaled the most wonderful perfume that he had ever had the pleasure of smelling. He felt a little light headedness with the aroma as it seemed to wrap its alluring fragrance around him. Then he heard a heavenly female voice it was melodious and so very attractive with a slightly foreign accent that simply made it wonderful to listen to.   
“I want you”  
He heard those three words and was surprised by the forwardness of this stranger and he turned to see what he could only later describe as the most perfect woman he had ever laid eyes upon. He looked up to see two dazzling big blue eyes that held such an intense colour. Her face was flawless framed by a wild mane of long gorgeous natural blonde hair. Not even casually his eyes looked at her body somehow expecting that such a beautiful face couldn’t possibly reside upon an equally attractive body but it did. This mysterious blonde was wearing a tight short black dress and her figure was incredible to Jacks appreciation. She had a tiny waist and an enormous contrasting chest and wide curvy hips tapering down into a long looking pair of shapely legs. For once Jack Steele felt speechless and almost as if he was in a trance completely absorbed in the undeniable beauty of this amazing creature that had approached him. She smiled a bright white Hollywood gleam at him between a pair of thick natural lips and then repeated her opening line  
“I want you, you will be mine”  
  
  
   
##Part 2  
  
Jack tried to prompt himself to say something but he was totally flummoxed by her forwardness and her appearance and this wasn’t like Jack he was normally so smooth and commanding around women and never searched for a witty response or something to say.  
“Yyyou want me?”  
He stuttered again something he rarely did.  
“Of course. You are a perfect little man”  
She offered a hand across and gently glided it around Jacks rugged square jaw line and her touch felt electric to him tingling his skin as those long fingers nails then retreated back leaving a solitary finger curled into a gesture that said follow me. He seemed to comply with her without thinking and stood up off of the bar stool and was astounded at the sight that greeted his eyes. This beautiful blonde was so tall that Jacks six foot five inches didn’t even measure up to her shoulder line! She towered over Jack like no woman or man ever had before and he gulped hard in disbelief as he realised just how short he was compared to her. Jack looked down expecting some ridiculous high heels upon her feet but she had the most modest of two inch heels beneath her and he knew even with out the shoes he would struggle to reach her chin level.   
“You , your so tall”  
The words rolled off of his tongue it was such an obvious reaction but not very cool of him to point out.  
“You have no idea”  
She grinned and then exhaled pushing her enormous endowments forward so they filled Jacks vision and forced him to step back to keep contact with her eyes. He couldn’t believe that he was only as tall as this beauty’s breasts and what magnificent breasts they were so large and firm and practically in his face.  
“Was that your girlfriend who entered here with you the short brunette?”  
The woman questioned and Jack felt he had to answer her somehow as if he was drugged to tell the truth.  
“Summer works with me”  
He simply stated as the blonde placed two large hands down upon his shoulders.  
“But you do find her very attractive don’t you?”  
“Yes”  
Jack was astonished he had admitted this so openly to a total stranger. What hold over him did this woman have he didn’t even know her name yet he was revealing things that he had told no one before?  
“I don’t like competition when I find a man that I want”  
“I’m all yours”  
Jack seemed to find words flowing from his mouth he felt that he would do anything just to be with this blonde. It was as if his manhood was given a voice and was speaking for him.  
“Looks like we will have to take a rain check shorty she is coming back. One last thing was that your red machine that you drove here in?”  
“My car? Yes it’s a red Jaguar”  
This whole encounter was bizarre for Jack he had been under the spell of this woman and the last sight he had of her was her parting kiss as she leaned down and planted those lips to his forehead rather than crouch to meet his lips. But she left a tingling sensation upon his skin that felt great.   
  
Summer walked up to Jack she hadn’t seen the woman and just found him stood with his jaw wide open in a kind of daze looking across the bar.  
“Jack? Jack you ok?”  
He said nothing and seemed frozen like a statue for a few seconds until Summer said his name louder and seemingly snapped him out of it.  
”Jack hey back to land of the living big guy!”  
“What, oh, Um Summer what happened?”  
“You tell me, is that lipstick on you?”  
Summer reached up from her five foot five inches to rub the fresh lipstick off of his face with her fingers.  
”You certainly don’t waste anytime do you?”  
”Holy **** that was all real?”  
“Jack what the hell happened to you?”  
“You won’t believe it but I think the woman that I’ve been looking for just tried hitting on me”  
Jack relayed most of the tale but left out the fact that he admitted his affection for Summer.  
“Do you think she used some sort of advanced hypnosis upon you and that’s why you seemed so taken with her and so compliant?”  
“I’m not sure it was like being myself and yet not being in control of myself. But Summer this woman was tall I mean probably seven foot without her heels on”  
“Are you sure?”  
”Hell I felt short against her and I never feel short believe me”  
“Wow then she will be a snap to pick out in a line up with legs like that. There can’t be too many women who hit the seven foot mark”  
“Dam it Summer I was so stupid like a love sick puppy I didn’t question her or even think about the case when I clapped eyes on her and now I don’t have a clue where she went”  
“Let’s notify the station to put out a description to all the guys in traffic, maybe someone will come across her”  
  
Jack called in from his mobile and Summer was shaking her head in disbelief at the description he was relaying and as he finished the call she sipped the last drop of her wine and smiled.  
“You must be kidding right? A 7ft version of Barbie is on the loose”  
“Summer I’m telling you that woman was….drop dead gorgeous”  
He said and could almost sense his comment made Summer a little jealous.   
“Mmm I take it you have a thing for tall girls then Jack?”  
This was something Jack had never thought about and had to admit to himself that there was a strange feeling he had when he stood looking up at the blonde mystery woman. A new feeling that yes he actually did enjoy in some way.  
“Well actually not many women tend to look down on me but now you mention it I guess there was something different about being shorter than a woman for a change”  
“Different? You liked being shorter?”  
Summer couldn’t help but dig a little she knew it was off topic but it was satisfying her own curiosity. One day she wanted to get together with Jack but didn’t know what really pushed his buttons and if being leggy was something he liked she felt her petite five foot five chassis was very far off the mark.  
“Um Summer we’d better head home”  
Jack changed the subject he felt a little strange discussing this new feeling and especially with Summer.  
“Sure”  
She replied and they finished their drinks and headed out to Jack’s car.   
  
As they walked to find it the car wasn’t there!  
“Just what I need can this day get any worse?”  
“Wait a minute Jack isn’t that your car over there?”  
The car was at the far end of the large car park but he could tell from a distance that it had been damaged as the light from the car park flood lamps reflected off the door skins and highlighted some creases along the body work.  
“Ah nuts! I’ve just finished paying for this as well!”  
He stomped angrily towards his damaged vehicle it seemed to have multiple creases upon its side panels and one impression on the roof where it sunk in just a little. But the strange thing was that the cars red exterior paint work seemed to have an almost translucent film covering half of it.   
”What on earth is this?”  
His hand touched the bonnet and slipped into the liquid it had a recognisable smell that was strong but he couldn’t place it.  
“What’s happened to your car what is this stuff it’s like….no that’s impossible”  
Summer didn’t express the answer that her mind raised.  
“Looks like your vandals have targeted me, Ill call the science lab and get them to check this stuff out maybe its some type of chemical, might even be a lead lets grab a cab and get home.”  
  
The next morning Jack woke early and was stood outside his flat. He had arranged for Summer to pick him up in her car whilst his had been towed away for inspection. A taxi arrived within minutes and Summer was in the back seat beckoning him to jump in.  
“Summer what’s going on?”  
Summer looked very sombre  
“My house was trashed last night and my car”  
“You’re joking?”  
“I wish that I was. I woke up last night because I heard a loud noise in the front garden but Jack I was too scared to even leave the front door”  
He could see that she was physically shaken even now and comforted her by placing a hand on the top of her knee.  
“Jack my car was crunched almost flat, my fences all on their sides in pieces and the thing that I heard was my garage. It’s trashed, the roof collapsed the brick work strewn across my lawn and driveway. My driveway has two craters inside it that have sunk the block paving 3ft down its ridiculous!”  
“Did you see any of it happen?”  
“No, well kind of. The street lamps had been snapped in half but as I stood at the window I saw a huge oak at the end of my garden come right out of the ground and fly into the street. But Jack there was nothing there, I felt like I was going mad!”  
“Hey calm down there must be a logical explanation for this and we are going to find it…together”  
  
When they arrived at the station they spent time filling out the paper work regarding the damage of their properties and some time later they met up in the incident room to discuss their next actions.  
They were deep in conversation reviewing both their cases.  
“Summer this team of vandals or what ever they are have obviously felt that you are too close to discovering them why else would they trash your home and car? And mine for that matter, they must have been tailing us yesterday when we left your crime scene and hence they did a number on me as well. They probably wanted to send us a message to say back off”  
“Actually I’m not so sure they did leave me a message but it was strange”  
Jack waited for her to continue.  
“I have the words “he’s mine” scraped into my lawn in letters that are about 4 foot tall and a foot deep”  
“He’s mine?”  
The words made Jack recollect those that had left the mystery blondes lips the other night but he knew these incidents couldn’t be related.  
“That’s even more peculiar, come on lets recap”  
Jack stood up and made notes on a white board.  
“Who ever is perpetrating these crimes of vandalism must be in charge of an organised gang of some sort. They must have some kind of machinery, heavy duty machinery to inflict the damage they have and more importantly there must be some purpose to their madness.”  
“You mean a political objective or something that they are going to announce when they own up to these various crimes in a public fashion, is that what you think?”  
“It has to be something like that Summer I mean think about it. The damage across all these cases isn’t gaining them anything, they haven’t stolen or targeted damage upon a rich single individual or a corporate body so what drives them?”  
They bantered for a while but didn’t get any closer to the answers they were seeking. It was then that the science lab sent up some results.  
“Thanks”  
Jack smiled taking the report paper from a young lads hand and he eagerly opened the envelope and pulled out the paperwork.  
”Lets prey the analysis from that liquid that was sprayed over half your car is some chemical that links them to a factory or something like that”  
Summer was anxious to hear the result. Jack began to read and his face dropped with a shocked expression that Summer picked up upon.  
“Jack what is it?”  
“There is no way this is true the boys in the lab must be winding me up”  
“Come on Jack let me in on it”  
“Summer according to this they tested that gunk on my car and although there are some irregularities as they put it they are certain that its…..”  
He briefly stopped and tried to find a polite way of putting it across  
“it’s bodily fluid from a woman”  
“come again”  
Summer shook her head.  
“Well the lab calculates that a woman must have saved up about a gallon or more of her lets say more intimate juices and poured them over the front end of my car”  
“No way!”  
“It’s here in black and white”  
Jack was reeling from this news nothing about this made sense at all.  
“I guess we have her DNA signature though, that’s something?”  
  
After lunch Jack received an intriguing call to his mobile.  
“Detective Steele I have some information for you about the disappearances meet me at the gates of Armstrong park at 6pm this evening and come alone, believe me I will know if you alert anyone else about our rendezvous.”  
The phone then went dead and Jack was suspicious, he knew this may be a set up but then it could be what he needed a break through. Without alerting Summer or any fellow colleagues he logged himself out of the station with an excuse of getting his car damage sorted to avoid raising any undue attention. He had to risk himself if this was a possible lead the danger sometimes came with the job.   
  
A cab dropped him off at the park gates and he could see nothing unusual except a very large non descript black artic lorry parked nearby, as he walked across to the gates the side door of the forty foot long lorry trailer opened and a man stepped out. The man was dressed in a black plain suit and ushered Jack inside. Once inside Jack met another two men similarly dressed but obviously under the command of the first man. They sprayed Jack with a light liquid it didn’t leave a mark on his clothes and after they finished a device much like the hand held scanners at the airport security gates was waved across him. Jack already knew these were not criminals they had to be part of some sort of special branch intelligence unit. Allowing Jack to enter deeper in the vehicle he walked past a mass of displays and hi-tech computer surveillance equipment before reaching the end of the vehicle where a few chairs and a table offered privacy from the rest of the trailer. Only the gentleman who originally met him came inside and Jack sat down.  
“Government Intelligence I presume?”  
Jack looked across at the balding forty something man who’s face was stony and very serious.  
“Something like that detective Steele, you can call me agent Hammond. All you need to know is everything I’m going to show and tell you from here on in you don’t repeat. Everything is top level security clearance ok?”  
”Sure”  
“The case you are investigating Mr Steele is one you won’t easily solve and one that I’m going to solve right here and now for you”  
“Go on”  
“We know that all your missing people are being held captive.”  
“Then they are all still alive?”  
“Very much so and no harm has to come to them”  
“Ok but where are they and what is this all about?”  
“No more questions for a moment detective let me explain Ok?”  
“We have a unique kidnapper roaming our city we don’t know her name but let’s just call her Brenda for now. Brenda is solely responsible for the disappearances of all the cases you are looking into. All we can make out is that Brenda is seeking men that she selects very carefully, I’m sure you have noted that every man she has chosen so far is a physically attractive male.”  
Jack nodded.  
“You have already met Brenda at the bar last night and now she is targeting you Detective, you are the next man who will disappear.”  
There was strong inhale from Jack as he listened further.  
“This woman isn’t worried you are a police man she doesn’t care about who you are or what you do. All she knows is that she likes the look of you and you fit the parameters of the males she is collecting”  
“Wait a minute collecting?”  
”Please allow me to continue Detective. You see Brenda has certain very unique abilities and technology at her disposal which you have seen the results of first hand. First of all this woman wears clothes that create some sort of field that can render her practically invisible.”  
“Oh come on I wasn’t born yesterday an invisible woman”  
Jack smiled this had to be an elaborate wind up of some sort.  
”I’m not joking, furthermore the clothes she wears can morph into different outfits at her whim. But this isn’t a scratch on her other abilities”  
“I’m not buying any of this, who ever you are.”  
“Oh you will, James move us to scene 47 and bring through sample 4 ok?”  
Agent Hammond spoke into his collar upon a two way radio and then looked back at Jack, the lorry was moving he could feel the motion.  
“Ok lets say you explain the last case of Sean Bordman the worker who disappeared from a sixty odd floor high construction site without a witness”  
“No problem but first you must open you’re mind. Brenda visited the site we tracked her there but too late to save Sean. Brenda stood outside the site perimeter she had already selected Sean and was waiting for her opportunity to grab him when he was more isolated. When she had spotted him on the high rise she turned herself invisible”  
“Right but there is no way even an invisible woman could get inside the perimeter fence and up the lift sixty something floors in less than five minutes because that’s the time duration between when he disappeared according to the witnesses compared to the last sighting of her. She would have to be some sort of super athlete, not to mention that makeshift lift takes several minutes to climb up to the top”  
Jack sat back in his chair and folded his arms.  
“She didn’t use the lift she doesn’t have to”  
“Now she flies?”  
“No, you see Jack, Brenda stepped over the perimeter fence and simply picked up Mr Bordman right where he stood, she undressed him and popped him in her pocket before she left”  
“what? Now you are telling me that this beautiful blonde is a giant woman?”  
“A giantess is more the appropriate terminology and yes, Brenda has the ability to assume any size she desires we monitored it all on our long range cameras. She stepped over the fence and continued to grow until she was taller than the building. When Sean was at waist height she reached down for him and he was simply overpowered by her giant hands and plucked up into the air like a little action figure”  
“Oh now this is rich you are telling me this woman can grow herself so that she is what more than a hundred feet tall, yeh right”  
“Mock all you want Detective but she normally walks around this city we figure more like two hundred feet tall and that’s on a short day”  
A man interrupted the meeting and grinned to see the totally bemused expression filling Jack’s face. He then spoke.  
“You want evidence Detective then that’s what we will give you”  
Agent Hammond and the other man looked as if they were passing a heavy object between them and placing it on top of the table but this looked like mime acting as there simply wasn’t anything there.  
  
  
   
##Part 3  
  
The lorry had come to a halt and Agent Hammond excused his colleague from the meeting asking him to bring the other items.  
“On the table before us is an invisible piece of clothing from Brenda, proof of her technology. Feel free to examine for yourself”  
Jack felt stupid but reached out his hands regardless and touched something that wasn’t visible. It was soft like silk, very smooth to the touch and there was a lot of it. He felt that it was a bundle of material perhaps three feet square and a foot deep as it was folded upon itself many times. He pulled it out and there seemed masses of material enough to cover the large table yet he couldn’t see anything in his hands but the weight and texture was there sure enough.  
“This is incredible, what is this?”  
“Invisible clothing like I said before, we recovered this when she must have gone for a skinny dip in Risers lake we guess she herself couldn’t find it afterwards but we managed to find several items that night using thermal cameras to find traces of her residual body heat in the clothing”  
“That’s how you track her by her body heat when she is invisible”  
“Very good Detective, we can track her thermal signature and even see her thermal image with our cameras but for short distances and mainly when she is giant sized. This vehicle is fitted with sophisticated thermal tracking units and we have been setting remote triggers throughout key points in the city just in a hope of triangulating her movements and discovering her base of operations which eludes us for now. So far we have been a little late to avoid any of the kidnappings but we are working on a new plan”  
  
Agent Hammond reached for a box under the table and found what looked like a high tech spray gun he pulled the trigger and sprayed the clear liquid from it across the table surface. There was a very slow glowing of a very large object outline that looked like a blanket and then the whole object materialised into view. Jack was gob smacked to see what he had been handling it was a giant sized woman’s silk thong a piece of female underwear that was probably twenty five or thirty feet across he couldn’t tell exactly because it wasn’t fully unravelled due to the constraints of being inside the lorry.  
“Believe it or not she was relatively short that night compared to what we have tracked before”  
“I don’t know what to say”  
He couldn’t imagine a woman big enough to fill this sexy garment and it sent chills down his spine.  
“Say you believe me”  
The next item was then placed down on the table with a thud and instantly sprayed to become visible. An enormous metal object appeared perhaps five feet long and half a foot wide.  
“A hair clip”  
Agent Hammond announced and Jack could see that now but it was so enormous.   
“This is a little much to take in”  
“There’s more step outside for a moment wont you”  
Jack walked through the operation centre of the vehicle and out the door he had originally entered. Stepping down from the lorry he recognised the property they stood before it was Summers.  
“Its ok your colleague isn’t around at the moment I just wanted you to see the indentations in the driveway”  
  
Just as Summer outlined there was a large depression that had sunk her paving blocks and another much smaller one several feet behind that. Jack now understood what it was but his mind didn’t want to make that conclusion.  
”Her footprint, Brenda did all this?”  
”Yes that’s one of Brenda’s high heels we figure she was about a hundred and fifty feet tall last night when she did a number on your girlfriend’s property”  
”Girlfriend? Summer’s a colleague”  
“Well Brenda must think other wise she doesn’t seem to tolerate any form of competition to those she selects you recall Tony Markham who was lured away from a night club on the east side? Well the day before she fixed his girlfriend”  
“You mean she killed her? That cant be because I interviewed her the day after and she was fine?”  
“Actually she was fine because we got to her very soon afterwards having tracked Brenda to the flat. We used hypnosis to erase certain things from her memory. Let’s get back in the lorry”  
As they climbed aboard Jack began to put a few things together in his mind.  
“The vandalism throughout the city its Brenda isn’t it? This explains so much, the couple in the car struck her giant foot with their vehicle when she was invisible, the loud speaker they heard was just her giant amplified voice from above. The trashed cars and property…”  
“Yes when Brenda is big she is pretty clumsy, we figure she gets around the city at height ranges between two hundred to five hundred feet tall I don’t think the down force of her true weight is somehow expressed all the time because we would have more reports of tremors and far more damage but she has had a few accidents so far just strolling from place to place”  
“The two buildings with their sides damaged”  
Jack thought aloud.  
“Ah the buildings on Norton Street , yes she’s pretty curvy as you know. I think her hips pressed on either side as she squeezed through the gap”  
  
All this was unbelievable yet it made perfect sense of all the cases Jack had heard. They showed Jack video recordings of the thermal signature belonging to Brenda walking amongst the familiar buildings he knew down town and although he couldn’t make out her shape very well he could tell she was simply gigantic.  
“Agent Hammond, you have me. I’m a believer the question I have for you is what is her agenda why is she collecting men?”  
”That we don’t have all the answers for I am afraid but we have some expert opinions”  
Again they walked to the rear of the trailer to speak more privately as the lorry was on the move once more.  
“There is one more revelation for you if you can handle it?”  
”Nothing would surprise me after today”  
“Brenda is an extra terrestrial”  
“Oh boy that’s a big one but out of everything it makes sense”   
“We first became alerted to her presence when the N.I.A.T.A remote tracking station followed her ship into our airspace about a month ago”  
“That’s not long before the first incident”  
Jack added  
“We don’t know where the ship is or even if it left but we think she is operating alone.”  
“N.I.A.T.A? I don’t know of them what does it stand for?”  
”You don’t need to know”  
Agent Hammond cut that question dead.  
“But what you do need to know Detective Steele is that she is some sort of predator picking on men which are the weaker sex to her. She needs men and she is a hunter who can track her targets. We know she operates anytime of day but she doesn’t walk around the city at her more elevated sizes if its rush hour I guess too much traffic to avoid with those huge feet of hers”  
“So why are you telling me all this”  
Jack knew there was going to be a catch as they had told him too much already.  
“So far we have failed to get close to her and track her back to a lair. We obviously want to recover the missing men….”  
”and her technology no doubt”  
Jack interrupted with a little scepticism of their full motives.  
“I can see you are no fool Detective we do have other vested interests in finding out about this creature she represents technology we could only dream about and further more we need to learn about her kind they pose a security threat to all nations on this planet. The bottom line Mr Steele is we don’t know what they want.”  
“Men that’s obvious surely?”  
”Can you imagine Detective if they sent a ship load of giant women and men to our planet they could overwhelm our defences in seconds take over the planet”  
“Agent Hammond no disrespect if they wanted to do that what’s stopping them? She is also not exposing herself to the general public there is a reason for that she doesn’t want to be found”  
“Well this is where you fit into things”  
Agent Hammond leant over the table and looked into Jack’s eyes.  
“She has already made a connection to you Jack and she will be coming back for you. We know how she operates and now we have an edge. You are the perfect candidate to discover everything about this alien and of course to rescue those men”  
Jack contemplated what he was being asked, it was his duty to find out more on this case but it sounded very dangerous to be used in this manor.  
“Are you sure she will continue to look for me?”  
“Definitely, you recall your meeting at the bar the other night. We were monitoring things about a quarter of a mile away. You see as I said before we have installed some motion sensors discreetly upon the sides of certain key buildings and luckily that night we managed to get there to see her leaving the bar.”  
“What the hell did she do with my car that night?”  
”Lets just say your car is no longer a virgin she must really like you and from what we know she is incredibly horny”  
“Oh, man that’s just disgusting”  
Jack imagined the giant blonde sat in the car park playing with herself using his car, the damage and evidence was consistent with this action.  
“Her species has a very high sex drive we know this”  
“Wait a minute Agent Hammond how do you know so much if you haven’t managed to get someone close to her?”  
“Ours is the second city she has targeted. The first was New York two years ago where one of her kind befitting her description took ten men over fortnight period. However one man a city banker was rejected by her we think this was because he is a registered carrier of a sexually transmitted disease, somehow she could detect this and he was left behind but he provided us with great insight”  
“So what do I expect if we go ahead with this?”  
“These are the facts we know. She has this ability to grow we don’t know what technology she uses to activate this, however the ring on her finger seems to be a device for reducing her targets stature.”  
“Woah, hold the phone this woman can grow into some colossal Godzilla sized proportions and she can shrink people as well?”  
“In a nut shell, yes. Her race seems to have mastered size in all aspects. You recall I mentioned the girlfriend of Tony Markham who you met?”  
”A sweet little thing. But very upset about her boyfriend’s disappearance.”  
“How tall would you say this sweet little thing was?”  
“Hell I don’t know 5ft dead if that, she was quite petite”  
“Would it then surprise you to know that she used to be five foot eleven inches tall before Brenda cut her down to size. Its kind of her way of dealing with competition she associates size with how alluring a female might be or at least that’s our hypothesis”  
“You’re joking”  
“I don’t joke Detective, with such an alteration in her height we had to use a special form of hypnotise upon her. We made her believe that she is suffering from a rare spinal compression condition whilst we figure out how to stop her from exposing her dramatic height decrease to the press. Luckily she doesn’t have any family in this country and they haven’t moved here until recently so that limits nosey outsiders”  
“We need to restore her”  
”Another incentive for you to complete this mission for us perhaps? Now Detective we also know she has a number of methods to lure her targets. One is a highly concentrated pheromone that she applies like a perfume upon herself. Somehow and we don’t understand this fully but it’s tuned into the DNA of the target you might have experienced this yourself?”  
“That’s how she had me distracted, dam I knew that I wasn’t myself she had me under her influence getting inside my head”  
“Don’t worry we have developed a nasal spray that will counter this effect and leave you in your true state of mind”  
“an advantage”  
”Yes also when its too public to take a subject she normally kisses them leaving a residue on their skin that acts like a beacon to her tracking devices it seems to die after a short time but normally enough for her to follow a target back home”  
“She kissed me on the forehead but Summer my colleague she wiped it off with her fingers”  
“Ah that’s probably how she tracked Summer and found her home she must have held residual traces”  
“Finally we know that the targeted victim can see her when she is lets say in giant mode, we think this is deliberate measure and something her stealth technology allows limiting only one individual of her choice to see her”   
  
Jack discovered they wanted to fit him with a sub dermal homing beacon basically to fit a small device under his skin that he could activate in order to broadcast his location when he wanted to be recovered. Ideally this would be at the location of her spacecraft. He had visions of the authorities sending in agents to capture this alien and her technology he didn’t know how much to trust them however he felt he had an obligation to try and save those unfortunate men and based on his knowledge of this Brenda she wouldn’t give up now he was a marked man in her sights. So Jack agreed to participate and they fitted the homing beacon under a false patch of skin on his right thigh. He was also provided with the nasal spray which would disable the effects of the pheromone apparently he learned they had found a sample from an almost empty container Brenda left from her exploits back in New York. This sample enabled them to synthesise a counter agent so he could resist her charms.   
  
Armed with little else but his own bravery Agent Hammond dropped Jack back at his own apartment wishing him good luck and impressing upon him the need for secrecy. The plan was set that Jack would go to the same bar later that night at ten o’clock and Agents Hammonds team would monitor from outside in the hope that Brenda would find him.  
  
Much later as Jack stood out on the balcony of his flat which offered him a view of a vast amount of the cityscape he wondered if an invisible Brenda was out there searching for him already tonight. Summer called his mobile as he stood there deep in thought anxious about the days to come.   
“Hey Summer how’s things?”  
”Fine and you? We missed you at the station you seemed to leave a little abruptly today”  
“Well you know how it is I just needed to get a few things sorted, any leads on your case Summer?”  
He felt awful for asking this of her but it was expected  
“Nothing except the strangest new report at Riser Lake”  
“Oh really?”  
Jack recalled Brenda had visited the lake according to Agent Hammond and that’s where he had recovered the clothing.  
“Yeh, they had an ice cream stand totalled pummelled into the ground and get this the vandals made out some giant foot prints in the soft dirt each one about twenty feet long! Must be a publicity stunt of some kind don’t you think? Aren’t they remaking King Kong this year?”  
“Wow guess those Hollywood types might be responsible or a marketing company it certainly sounds unusual”  
Jack tried to sound convincing  
“Anything new your side?”  
“Well yes I’m following up a hot lead but I can’t say anything at present without jeopardising my contacts security”  
“Not even to me Jack?”  
“Um for now no I cant sorry Summer”  
“Jack”  
She paused as if summoning up courage  
“Jack you recall the job I applied for last month?”  
“Working for Chief Inspector Ratner’s group as a specialist?”  
“Yes, well they want me and I’ve decided to go”  
Jack wasn’t pleased he didn’t want Summer out of his workplace he knew that he might never see her again.  
“Um this is what you want right Summer?”  
“Jack can I talk with you tonight?”  
“Tonight?”  
He could sense she had something to say and maybe it wasn’t work related he agreed and was stunned to hear she was already there.  
“You are outside my flat?”  
  
  
##Part 4  
  
“I’m in the car park below, the red escort if you can see me it’s a hire car”  
Jack peered several hundred feet below and saw a red hire car parking up.  
”Look Jack I was just coming back from the gym and I needed to speak with you, do you mind?”  
”No of course not Ill buzz you in down the bottom grab the lift I’m on the top floor flat 501”  
  
Summer arrived at his door and Jack opened it allowing her to step in. She seemed kind of nervous and there was something odd about her he couldn’t place. He had never seen her outside of work dressed in such casual clothes and her gym wear consisted of a tight pink lycra outfit with white trainers. She did have a very nice figure he could see that clearly, a small waist nice shapely legs and a great backside in that tight lycra. As she stepped inside of the flat he noticed (due to his own considerable height advantage) that he could see straight down into the neck of her top. It was the most cleavage he had ever seen displayed by Summer and it confirmed that she did have a nice pair of breasts something he had checked out on many occasions being a man but it was often hard to tell in her more conservative work outfits. As he took his eyes out of her top and followed her into his living room he knew what seemed odd about her, she seemed rather shorter than he recalled. He offered her a drink and they stepped out onto his balcony to enjoy the warm evening as they chatted.  
  
Jack began to wonder if Brenda had performed her jealous magic on Summer and reduced her she did seem very short this evening only reaching his chest area in height, somehow he had to ask about her height and test this theory.  
“So I’m leaving probably tomorrow Jack as soon as possible and I wanted you to know first”  
“Thanks, it’s a little sudden isn’t it?”  
“I needed to get away from our station break the ties so that I can move on with my life”  
“I see”  
“It’s so hard to work with someone, to be so close and not….”  
She was about to confess her real reason for leaving, she wanted to change her career to open up the option for Jack and herself to have a relationship that wouldn’t interfere with their professional duties but it was hard for her to get the words out and to finally test if Jack felt the same way about her after these years of minor flirting and constant longing. Somehow she compelled herself to come there tonight and speak to him more openly and it was a case of testing the water with his feelings.  
“I’m sorry what did you say?”  
Jack was distracted looking at her height again she was far from the height he recalled and was sure she was normally over his shoulder he had to test this.  
”Jack is something on your mind?”  
“I was just thinking forgive me but you look different tonight Summer”  
“Different?”  
She smiled hoping he had noticed her figure in her tight work out clothes, she was proud of her curves and worked out hard to keep everything firm. From her tiny twenty one inch waist to her curvy thirty two inch hips she knew that men noticed her in the gym and more than one man would also end up staring at her breasts with a firm thirty four E cup she knew that her chest was always commanding attention. Tonight had her appearance final broken down the cool Jack Steele barriers and was he about to pass a compliment her way that could really break the ice.  
“Well Summer I think you look kind of short”  
Her heart sank at his words, short wasn’t a compliment and further more she recalled his reaction towards the blonde he met the night previously. Jack was so taken with this woman’s extraordinary stature this didn’t make her feel at all confident stood before his towering muscular presence. Jack was a big man, tall and built like a powerful athlete she had often peeked at him working out at the stations gym and at six foot five he did tower over her. Jack saw her face drop to an expression he couldn’t read, had he offended her?  
”Sorry I didn’t mean anything by that it’s just well you normally look a lot taller. You are actually quite petite I’ve never really noticed what are you five foot three or four?”  
Summer couldn’t help but frown a little.  
“I’m five foot five Jack you’ve just never seen me in flat shoes before. I’m the same as I’ve always been. Only I wear reasonable heels to work.”  
She paused and then continued  
“I realise now that you like tall women don’t you Jack? Like the woman last night perhaps?”  
Jack was surprised to hear her height and wondered if that was correct. He couldn’t help thinking that perhaps having been reduced by Brenda in the same manor as Tony Markham’s partner that Summer may be under hypnotic suggestion as they spoke. Thus she would not recognise her true height and having the desire to change jobs presented to her this way no one she directly came in contact with would notice the change. All these thoughts went through his head and he didn’t answer her question because he didn’t hear it. Summer concluded Jack was only into taller women and she obviously didn’t hit the mark given her average stature, perhaps she had read the signals between them wrong and this was all a mistake?  
“Jack look I err must go can I use you toilet”  
“Over there on the left Summer”  
He was glad of the distraction and used his skills to swiftly check for ID by rifling through her bag. Finding her gym membership card it was dated and read her height off at 65 inches. He knew they couldn’t be that thorough and alter things so fast he must have made a mistake, which meant nothing had altered about Summer he just figured she was taller, was he getting paranoid he asked himself?  
Returning from the toilet summer seemed very flustered he almost thought she had been crying.   
“Summer are you ok?”  
“I, I’m fine Jack , look I don’t know why I’m here, I had better leave”  
She made for the door and he took her arm in a gentle manor to halt her hasty exit , it had only just dawned on him that she was trying to sound his feelings out about her decision to leave.  
“Summer I don’t want you to leave your job”  
“My minds made up Jack it’s a new start for me”  
He debated if he should step across the line and reveal his feelings for her but she opened the door whilst he was in mid thought easing from his grip.  
“Look Jack I’m going to say this one time only”  
She plucked up courage knowing she was half way out the door.  
“Jack look, I came here tonight because I made the decision to change my job so that we might be able to explore if there is a possible relationship between us. No, don’t say anything now Jack hear me out. I have wanted to be with you ever since we first met but I know that breaks regulations and I know it would jeopardise both our careers. As of tomorrow Jack I no longer work with you or even in the same station as you and if you want to be with me there should be nothing stopping us. If you feel the same way I will be at Rigolota the Italian restaurant on fourth Street 8 o’clock tomorrow night”  
Before Jack could say a word she slipped out the door making it clear she didn’t wish for him to react there and then. So now he knew Summer felt the same way as he did only she was brave enough to make something happen and committed enough to alter her career to open the doorway for him.   
  
It seemed like his private life might finally take off and he sat back on the balcony and enjoyed a cold drink smiling to himself until he noticed the time with some alarm.  
“Heck!”  
He should have been back to the bar by now which was verified by his cellular phone ringing minutes later after he had used the nasal spray and hurriedly exited the building dressed in his jeans and a t-shirt.  
“Detective you are late?”  
A rather formal and condescending voice belonging to Agent Hammond began to complain.  
“We are not playing games here detective this is serious work and we expect you to do your part”  
“Yeh, keep your hair on I’m on my way, I just need to grab a cab”  
“That won’t be necessary I’ve taken the liberty of sending a car for you, it’s a black Mercedes saloon they will find you any minute”  
The phone went dead and as if by magic a Mercedes rolled up as Jack walked across the car park adjacent to the building he lived in. The agents inside didn’t offer any chatter it was very much  
business faces and formalities for the two of them however they did offer him luck with the mission as they dropped him off and then unexpectedly offered him the keys to the vehicle and informed it was at his disposal until he was told otherwise. A nice perk Jack thought to himself as he clutched the keys and walked off to the bar entrance.  
  
Leaning over the beer stained bar Jack kept an eye on the main entrance but all was very quiet. By his second whisky he feared she wouldn’t be coming tonight. At twelve o’clock sharp the bar tender called time on the bar and Jack was the last customer left lingering over his another scotch.   
“Sorry pal but you will have to leave now”  
The bar tender prompted and Jack downed his drink in one and stepped out of the door.  
  
It was still outside with a few late evening stragglers making their way home half intoxicated by the look of their walks and Jack stood on the door step of the bar giving the area one last look. The Mercedes was waiting for him across the car park but he didn’t want to leave yet he wanted to give it a few minutes more. He wasn’t a smoker so lighting up a cigarette as a natural delay tactic was out of the question so he pretended to adjust the laces on the casual leisure boots he was wearing. Knelt down he then noticed a shadow fall over him something was blocking the light that had been projected from the bars neon sign above the door?   
  
He didn’t move pretending for now he hadn’t noticed a thing continuing to address his laces. It was then he felt a presence next to his body to one side. First it was a noise a footfall perhaps two invisible beings one to his left and now the other on his right, was Brenda travelling with another invisible companion? His answer came very rapidly when materialising out of thin air he began to noticed a very large black high heeled woman shoe emerging in his peripheral vision on his left! As its form became clearer and left the concealment of its invisible cloak he gulped to see that this left shoe he was looking at was nearly two foot long from heel to toe. The shoe was also facing the same direction as his own which meant only one thing there would be an identical large shoe on his right hand side and that meant Brenda was standing directly over him! Without turning his head he looked out of the corner of his eye and confirmed the presence of her right shoe and the long tanned unmistakably feminine shapely leg rising from it. She was tall, incredibly tall but not as giant sized as he would have expected but it was intimidating enough that she could stand with her legs apart and must have stepped over him or worse she placed them either side of the bar door and he walked right under her. Slowly Jack stood up and wished he hadn’t as his face fell under the veil of a large skirt. There was a loud laugh as Brenda was amused by his position, Jack was now stood below her and beneath the canopy of her skirt. He had to act alarmed to her presence in order that he didn’t give away his mission but the truth was that he was alarmed and felt nervous in Brenda’s presence.   
“What the!”  
Jack exclaimed and walked quickly forward as the soft material draped over his head and dropped away, he instantly spun around to see a pair of towering long legs facing him. A remarkable set of legs that were shapely and athletically toned in the right places a very sexy pair of legs that stood over seven or eight feet high!  
  
This alien female was standing somewhere in the region of thirteen or fourteen feet tall and looked nothing like he had recalled. She was still undeniably sexy with a very curvy set of hips and a slim waist that contrasted so well against the more than ample swell of her breasts that proudly pushed forward above him yet everything about her was so much bigger! Jack stepped back retreating several more feet and now he could take in her new proportions as she towered over him. She was wearing a short blue skirt and a simple white t-shirt that was fitted following every line of her body and stretched over her curves like a second skin. His eyes delighted in every detail as they climbed up to discover her face. He was sure her breasts as they projected forward in that top could easily have taken his whole head and it sent shivers of pleasure down his spine as he stood in her presence combined with an increasing feeling of insecurity rising inside him as she was the most intimidating woman he had ever encountered. Her face was much larger than before yet amplified if possible revealing her natural beauty.   
“Well hello again handsome”  
Jack heard the same wonderful voice and this huge blonde bombshell smiled down at him with her hands resting upon her hips in a confident manor as she looked over her considerable bust to find his eyes below.  
“What the!”  
Jack did his best to pretend he was startled and backed away a few steps.  
“Don’t be scared little one after all I’m only a woman”  
She paused watching his now bulging eyes looking her up and down.  
“Do you remember me Jack? I’ve come back for you my little man”  
Jack was alarmed now as she knew his name which put him off guard maybe she was on to him somehow? He hadn’t expected this and now his cover may have been blown in which case he could be in a lot more trouble. Jack casually blipped the central locking of the Mercedes across the car park readying this avenue of escape.   
“Who are you? What are you?”  
He said and another smile broke her lips.  
“I’m your destiny Jack and I’m all woman”  
With a very seductive tone she slid her hands down the outline of her body as she emphasised the “all woman” in her words.  
  
Even without the pheromone effect Jack found himself drawn to look at her she was exceptionally attractive yet unlike last time he knew he could now focus on the task in hand.  
“What do you want?”  
He said backing up a little more and closing towards the car.  
“I want you Jack Steele”  
Jack bolted for the car the mission had to be aborted she knew his name and perhaps that he was setting her up. But Brenda didn’t follow at first she just stood there laughing at his attempt to escape. When he jumped in and slammed the door he fumbled for the ignition and turned over the huge V8 engine which roared into life. As he was about to slam the accelerator down the car screamed as if he had selected neutral upon the manual gear box it was free revving loudly. In a slight fluster he looked down at the gear lever and check it was engaged when he felt the rear wheels were not touching the ground! Looking into the rear view mirror Brenda had lifted the bumper and suspended the tail of the vehicle from the floor by several inches so it had no traction.  
“Don’t run away Jack not when we were about to get to know each other”  
Her words sounded through the car and he couldn’t help but notice she was growing as the car tilted up at the rear. Jack was amazed at the strength of this amazon, she was probably twenty or so feet tall now crouched down and holding the car back with ease! Just when he was about to relax the power fortune smiled upon him as the rear moulded bumper broke free of the chassis and the car slammed down with a jolt allowing Jack to speed away. In his mirrors he could see Brenda dusting her hands off as she watched him moving swiftly down the road. Entering from a junction to the main road he nearly struck a car in his haste to jump onto the inside carriageway which wasn’t helped by his single handed control as he searched to retrieve his mobile phone. He thumbed through the received call directory trying to find Agent Hammonds number when the phone rang.  
“Jack!”  
It was agent Hammond sounding very concerned.  
“Jack she is on to you, get yourself out of there now!”  
“What the hell happened?”  
“She disabled our operations vehicle about 5 minutes ago, she destroyed our communications and tracking equipment pulled it clean off the truck and then stranded us on top of a department store!”  
It was hard in the heat of the moment for Jack to imagine just how large she would have to be to lift that articulated lorry but he knew it was dam big and having preoccupied the agents she came for him moments later he was counting his lucky stars that he had managed to evade her.  
“Agent Hammond I need to……”  
Jack dropped the phone dead as his hands both tackled the steering wheel. Up ahead on the road he witnessed Brenda and she was straddling the carriageway and probably was fifty feet tall!   
  
In seconds he manoeuvred between her legs and drove straight under her watching those gigantic shoes as they flashed past. Suddenly he could hear her steps, each loud thud as his rear view mirror was filled with a pair of lorry sized black court shoes approaching very rapidly from behind she was literally getting bigger and bigger with every second of the pursuit and keeping pace with his now 90mph excessive speed. Spotting a tunnel up ahead he focused on entering it before Brenda could stop him.  
  

##Part 5  
  
He made the tunnel just in time and inside its protective shelter he managed to calm himself down. The tunnel was over two miles long but it cut through a large hillside which Brenda would have to negotiate slowing her down. His main thought was to head for home he knew Brenda wouldn’t try anything if he was inside such a building as the huge block of flats he resided in. It would be a race against time and a gamble for him upon the ground this giant woman could cover in competition to himself. Sticking the car into top gear he was now pushing one hundred and twenty five miles per hour screaming through the light traffic inside the tunnel. If he made the flats in time Brenda would have to give up chase or shrink down and even the odds to come inside after him.  
  
With his plan rolling through his mind Jack didn’t notice at first the exit of the tunnel and the peculiar shape of the last few metres of its ceiling. Slowing down to a more sedate seventy miles per hour he suddenly realised that the tunnel was ending and he would be travelling under the two arches of a pair of high heeled women’s shoes! Brenda was toying with him. As he drove under the shoes he marvelled at the sight as he caught just a glimpse of the now colossal Brenda standing in those shoes that could create bridges to the tiny vehicles below her. It was a good job that she was invisible to the rest of the public or this sight would have cause a massive shock to the drivers around him. Having once again passed underneath Brenda, Jack made a very hurried journey through some tight back roads heading for home. All the time he kept an eye out for Brenda who he seemed to have evaded for now. As he screeched to a halt in the car park of his building he abandoned the car and walked straight for the main entrance when a loud voice caught his attention. He looked up to see Brenda not out of breathe at all and looking as if she had been waiting for him. She was now about thirty feet tall and leaning casually with her shoulder up against the building.  
“I do like a challenge Jack you are certainly a feisty one”  
Ignoring her taunts he made for the door when Brenda stepped around the corner to block his way.  
“You are not thinking of hiding from me are you little man? Because there is no where you can hide that I cannot find you.”  
Jack looked at her confident pose as she now blocked his way with her back resting on the wall above the entrance and her legs either side of the double doors. He pictured this was how she stood when he exited the bar.   
“Aren’t you more than a little curious about a big woman like me Jack?”  
“Look I don’t know who you are lady or how you got so big but just please leave me alone”  
  
Trying to demonstrate some confidence Jack folded his arms and stood his ground in a confrontational manor which seemed to please Brenda.  
“How cute but you know you cant resist me Jack , better to give yourself willingly to me now because I wouldn’t wish to accidentally hurt you if I have to take you by force”  
“By force, why do you want me so bad?”  
”Because you are a perfect little man, so attractive and so well formed. You will be my prized possession”  
Jack didn’t like the word possession and decided he would run towards the side entrance of the building to avoid her. As he bolted towards his destination he could hear Brenda laughing.  
“I see you like a good game of cat and mouse Jack, and so do I!”  
He made for the door which led to the internal stairwell and jack ran inside looking back to see if she would enter. She didn’t and he suspected that she may be entering the building from the main reception area. Walking out onto a lower level he made it to a lift and back to his flat without a challenge. He double bolted his door and then he realised that he had left his mobile phone in the car and he cussed at that mistake because there was no way he could contact Agent Hammond and his team. But as usual Agent Hammond was on the ball and had predicted where Jack would head the phone rang on the wall and Jack grabbed it.  
“Jack?”  
”It’s me. Brenda is here she’ll probably be busting into my flat any second or waiting outside for me to leave….”  
Agent Hammond cut Jack dead.  
“Jack just stay there we have two units making their way to you now if we can keep her there long enough we may get the opportunity to track her or if we can find her inside the building she will have to reduce herself and then she’s ours! There will be no more advantage!”  
  
The phone went dead and Jack poured himself a stiff drink and downed it in one as he played the waiting game feeling like he was the bait. Opening his balcony doors he stepped outside to look for any signs of Brenda below or the agent’s vehicles arriving. All was quiet nothing stirred except the traffic way off in the distance. Perhaps Brenda has decided to stake out the building he thought? Or maybe she would barge into his flat any second, he had to hope the agents could make their move before she did. Turning to walk back inside the flat he bumped into something as he approached the two doors! Jack felt a sudden shiver run down his spine the object that blocked his way was invisible but very large. He looked around there was no sign of Brenda but what blocked his way obviously came from her. He extended his hands forward and it was a smooth cylinder about 8ft long and lodged diagonally across his doors reaching one side of the balcony to the other. Jack tried to wrap his arms around it but its girth exceeded his grip and its weight was too much to budge as he strained. Suddenly the object began to expose itself materialising foot by foot until he gasped at what he had been wrestling with. It was a giant lipstick applicator and so enormous he was unable to shift it from its wedged position and now he was trapped outside stranded on his own balcony by its presence. Somehow seeing this red lipstick tube his efforts were doubled to remove it he didn’t want a simple feminine object like that to get the better of him but it had and his struggles proved in vein.  
  
“Meow”  
A heavy voice sounded from behind him it was clearly Brenda but he couldn’t see her.   
“Looks like the big feline has the little mousy cornered”  
She said and he could feel the wind from her words a force blowing into him which carried the freshness and purity of her breath along with it. Jack backed up against the lipstick cylinder and away from the edge of the balcony railing he had no where to go other than a several hundred foot drop either side of him. Feeling the huge lipstick tube against his back he wondered just how gigantic Brenda was right now but didn’t have to wait very long to find out. It was her long blonde hair that materialised first glistening in the evening sky followed by her immense face , she was an enormous giantess and so tall that her chin was level with the upper rail of his balcony which meant there was several hundred feet of this blonde travelling down to the ground below! Her large blue eyes flashed lovely full eyelashes batting them quite naturally and Jack was in awe of her as he looked at the plump almost exaggerated fullness of her lips that outlined a very cavernous mouth. She produced a very large smile that stretched the width of the platform he stood on and winked cheekily at Jack who’s face betrayed him with the awe of seeing such a large woman standing almost as tall as the building he lived within.   
“Feeling small little man? Don’t worry you soon will do”  
Following these words Jack watched her increase in height until her slender neck rose above the balcony followed by the mammoth proportions of her bust as it lined up with his level pushing her height above that of his building in a matter of seconds. For Jack the view was stunning and exceedingly sexy as the magnitude of her breasts behind the vast white expanse of her simple t-shirt presented itself so dramatically. He gawped open mouthed at the sheer enormity of the impressions behind that material it was stretched taught and made thin enough that the pattern of a pretty lacy bra could be faintly made out and she was so large that these colossal breasts dwarfed him with their presence. The plunging line of deep cleavage at the top of her t-shirt looked huge yet only a fraction of its size and volume was truly revealed. Never had Jack seen such a sight it both scared him and wowed him at the same time, stirring new sensations inside. In his wildest dreams he couldn’t have imagined a woman’s body to be so imposing. His gaze was locked to her chest and he had forgotten the giantesses face above these breasts as they commanded his attention gently moving behind the material as they shifted with her body. He was suddenly broken out of this lustful stare and back to reality when Brenda spoke.  
“That’s better don’t you think? I do so hate feeling short”  
Brenda began and looked towards the tiny figure of Jack who was now desperately wondering how he could escape such a woman.   
“Looks like your little allies have come to rescue you Jack how cute they really don’t know who they are dealing with do they?”  
Easing back from the balcony edge Brenda looked down by her shoes which had grown to the size of regular articulated lorries and watched the two black saloon cars screeching to a halt in the car park. Jack moved to the edge of the balcony peering down to see what looked like two government vehicles arriving he couldn’t help but gasp at how enormous Brenda was as he compared her to the small men below who exited the car. He watched them assuming positions using their doors for cover and pointing weapons up at this enormous woman. Jack was glad that they could see her and realised they must have been wearing thermal imaging head gear. With Brenda’s attention distracted he would have another go at the lip stick container. Using his full brute force he slammed his body into its side yet failed to budge it from its wedged position and did little but bruise his shoulder.  
“What are you doing Jack? Please don’t damage my lipstick that’s my favourite shade.”  
Brenda laughed seeing the futile attempts Jack was making.  
“I must teach your little friends below to respect a woman so I’m just going to have to keep you out of trouble for a few minutes if you won’t keep still”  
A mass of long natural blonde hair shook free from a black patterned scrunchy as Brenda released her locks from a ponytail allowing it to fall over her shoulders and down her back. In the seconds that followed Jack was taken by surprise as giant female fingers each as long as he was tall clasped around his body engulfing his entire frame with ease. He struggled but how could he counter the strength of a giant woman this size? Jack was easily overpowered and before he knew it he felt another hand reaching towards him and pulling some soft yet tight material over his body.  
When the hands receded away he was lying on the floor of the balcony and his arms and upper legs were immobilised by the gigantic scrunchy that encircled almost his entire body! Brenda giggled and winked a huge blue eye at him.  
“Hope it’s not too tight on you but it should keep you out of mischief tiny”  
Jack couldn’t believe his predicament he was wrapped inside an elastic lined piece of feminine material that smelt simply wonderful as it lingered of a subtle fragrance presumably from her hair that had been just where he now was. He shifted like an ungraceful caterpillar until he could use the rails of the balcony to lean against and stand himself back up. When he had recovered to his feet he hopped around in order to see over the edge and watch the action.   
  
By now the agents that stood in the protective cover of their vehicles had begun to address Brenda he could hear their small voices in the distance but couldn’t appreciate what they were saying.   
“I don’t think so”  
Brenda’s voice boomed a reply back to them her giant ears obviously more capable than Jack’s.  
The exchanges seemed to continue as Brenda advanced one small step to confront them with a pair of giant high heels that dwarfed their cars in size. Jack wondered just how intimidated those men below must have been facing a woman of such proportions.  
“I suggest that you little insects run away now, you wouldn’t want to upset a lady now would you? Especially one who is so much bigger than you are”  
The men stood their ground and Jack strained to hear their responses it seemed like they were not going to budge.  
“Perhaps it would help if you could really see how small you are to me”  
Brenda began and Jack noticed her clothes glowed for a split second and he realised that she was presumably revealing herself from her invisibility.  
  
Anyone looking at his building would now see the curvaceous figure of this giant blonde standing with her hands resting on her hips probably obscuring most of his building from a distance in the skyline.   
“Look at them Jack they are half terrified yet half turned on just like yourself, it must be quite something to see women my size when you are such tiny delicate little beings. I bet they are having quite the show from down there looking under this little revealing skirt of mine”  
Brenda laughed and then rested a huge shoe effectively eclipsing one of the cars from Jacks view beneath its sole. He watched the men fleeing away towards the safety of the other car parked parallel and then Brenda grinned to see their reaction.  
“Oops! Did I step on something?”  
Her words came as her foot pressed down on the car its suspension collapsing in and instant as the body shell crumpled under the extreme weight. With a sound Jack would never forget the car compressed outwards and was flattened but surprisingly didn’t explode. Brenda reached down further stunning the men below who backed away for cover fearing her hands would reach for them.  
They fired their weapons in a panic but Brenda was simply removing the crumpled remains from under her shoe and picking it up for inspection. She held the flat car in between her fingers and straightened back up to display it before Jack which simply astonished him, one because she could lift it so easily and two because it was destroyed almost beyond recognition as a car.  
“Oh dear what have I done? Do you think they’ll want to keep it?”  
She laughed as gunfire continued down below challenging that laughter. Jack ducked his head as the car was lifted over him and placed on the top of the flat roof of his building as she discarded it like a tiny piece of refuse.  
“You think I scared them Jack, should I step on a few of them?”  
“Don’t hurt them!”  
Jack shouted seeing her attention had dropped once again to the ground below.  
“I’m not a killer Jack I’m a nice girl and besides I wouldn’t want to stain these new shoes of mine. Its time I left little man its seems I’m drawing too much attention and your coming with me”  
  
A glow briefly flickered from her clothes and once more Jack knew that no one else except himself would actually be able to see her with their naked eyes anymore. Brenda turned to the balcony and then raised up higher than before perhaps growing even more in Jacks appreciation until the railings of his balcony where lower than her enormous chest. Tilting forward she partially rested a fraction of the weight of her womanly forms onto the balcony and the rail buckled allowing her cleavage to be suspended several feet before Jack. It was a literal wall of female flesh that settled in his path as her thin t-shirt spilled over the entire balcony and beyond both sides. The low v neck of her top allowed a towering line of cleavage to be displayed that was almost vertical and probably stretching over ten or fifteen feet high. All Jack could see was the volume of these colossal breasts presented before him and he was dumb struck in awe of their new size close up like this but he had little time to admire this sexy vista before it consumed him in his entirety.  
“Sorry Jack no time for any pockets to carry you in right now but I do find my giant bra here does such a great job of holding you tiny little men. So in you go”  
Jack felt something pushing him from behind and he was soon against that cleavage line and slipping in between her giant breasts. As he was tucked several feet into her deep flesh he was surrounded in an instant warmth and powerful perfume whilst he felt those breasts rise and fall with each of her tremendous steps. Meanwhile from below the agents once more donned their thermal imaging devices to see the huge outline of Brenda as she simply stepped over them and made her way carefully down the street. Jack was having a bumpy ride feeling every shock wave of her steps translated through her great bosom he was trying to right himself and managed to squeeze himself up like an inch worm enough that he could peer out of her cleavage and see the city passing below. Brenda was a stupendous size he watched landmark buildings that didn’t even reach her chest now and he flinched every now and then as he caught glimpses of her huge high heels that narrowly missed cars and people below. What he couldn’t understand was that as big as she was he couldn’t hear her footfalls and her weight didn’t seem to be making any depressions in the road. He took his attention from the vast fall below to look up at the giantess and now from his current position he could only see the underside of her beautiful flawless features. Her smooth neck rose into her chin which was ledge like as it jutted out and he could see her projecting thick lips above this and the underside of two mammoth nostrils with long fan like eyelashes batting higher up still. She wasn’t paying attention to him but concentrating on the pathway she was forging through the small roads and between the buildings around her. Suddenly a helicopter abruptly swooped over head. It surprised Jack and he looked at it hovering dangerously close to Brenda it could see her!   
  
The helicopter was black and had no markings for registration but did have some unusual equipment attached to the nose which Jack guessed was more imaging technology so he knew again this was a government vehicle. Would they attempt to rescue him to lower a grab line so he could climb out of her breasts? Jack wondered as Brenda addressed the aircraft.  
“Cant a girl have any peace?”  
She glanced down at Jack  
“I hope you like big boobs Jack because these are going to get a lot bigger”  
   
   
##Part 6  
  
A smile crossed her face and Jack felt the already enormous breasts swell even larger around him. The width of her cleavage dramatically widened until he was no longer being held by the breasts aside his body and he was sinking into her flesh and the depths of her bra. Jack watched her chin rise higher as the boobs rose from large hills into small mountains! He found himself at the base of her bra directly between her breasts and luckily able to grab the lacy decoration in order to save himself from falling out of her top to his certain doom, her scrunchy had scaled with her and he had slipped through it leaving it trapped somewhere in her cleavage above. Brenda was now taller than every building around her even the largest of the skyscrapers she could have rested her elbow upon in a casual fashion only Brenda wasn’t increasing her height to rest. Whilst Jack held on for the ride she reached up for the helicopter and managed to avoid its whirling blades clasping it’s under carriage in her fingers and holding it like a toy. She squashed the outer engine casing by closing her fingers upon it from both sides and the pilot and navigator just hoped those immense fingers were not going to crush them along with it. The engine spluttered to a dead halt and belched with smoke as Brenda placed it down onto the highest of the buildings at her side it was totally disabled and the two occupants very disoriented at the speed she performed these actions. Now she was only being tracked from the ground yet with her fantastic height each of her new strides covered a distance that out paced the many cars below. Stepping across raised roads, bridges and across the width of the local river to the other side she evaded the government attempts to pursue her. Jack didn’t know what was going on or how far he had travelled but finding himself helpless inside a giant woman’s bra held nestled between her magnificent breasts he was surprised that part of his current jeopardy he was enjoying. Soon the vast space around him began to contract, Brenda was reducing her height.   
  
Jack soon found his space a lot more cramped as her breasts gently closed in on him and he was forced to stand straight up with his feet on the centre band of her bra and his head sticking out of those curves.   
“I do so hate coming down to these tiny sizes”  
She muttered to herself and plucked Jack out into the palm of her hand.  
“Looks like we are alone little one so its time for me to shrink you”  
Extending the ring finger of her free hand towards him a green glow emitted from the small gemstone and Jack soon found her hand beginning to expand becoming a vast platform before his very eyes.   
“What are you doing to me?”  
He shouted frightened to find himself dwindling in the palm of this woman.  
“If I have to get small then you need to get even smaller don’t worry it wont hurt a bit”  
  
In seconds Jack’s size stabilised and he couldn’t see over her hand that held him and as he peered up from that hand Brenda was for an instant the largest thing he had ever witness in motion her face seemed miles away and out of focus and he did feel terrified in her presence until she began to shrink. When Brenda settled her size he realised that the world around him was now out of normal proportion and that he was tiny in real world terms. She stood on a street corner and he could see buildings rising like mountains above her and other giants walking past in the distance. He had to be one inch tall from head to toe something Brenda soon clarified for him as he was placed back in her cleavage.  
“Wow my ring really does work on you Jack, you know some men seem to have a resistance to it and I fail to get them below seven inches tall and a seven inch man is kind of a challenge to conceal in my bra even with these great big breasts. But you are just ideal Jack so very susceptible to shrinking just look at you barely an inch tall in there making my boobs massive around you and plenty big enough to hide you in.”  
With that statement she proved her point and her hands parted her breasts as she shook them and he slipped below engulfed by her flesh and trapped at the base of her bra. His view was a wall of white soft material and beyond more white material of her t-shirt.   
“Keep quite and behave in there little Jack if you know what’s good for you”  
What else could he do? He was riding in between her breasts and as far as the world knew all they could see was some gorgeous amazon blonde on the outside. After being jiggled around for a few minutes he heard the sound of a door opening perhaps a lift and then shortly after this he was plucked out of her bosom and into her hand again.  
“That’s better now I can really get a good look at you my little prize”  
“Where am I?”  
“You are in my hand of course”  
“No, where am I?”  
Brenda laughed at him and then held her palm flatter so he could see where she had taken him. It was a normal looking room offering a large bed and a vanity area with very sumptuous fixtures and fittings which Jack recognised as a regular hotel room.  
“A hotel?”  
“What were you expecting a space ship?”  
“I err…”  
Jack didn’t know what to say and Brenda seemed quite fascinated with his small form stood upon her hand bringing her large blue eyes closer towards him. He had never seen such penetratingly blue eyes or ones of such a large scale they were simply beautiful like the rest of her and he could have lost himself in those eyes as they stared at him.  
“You are perfect Jack such a handsome little man”  
  
Feeling increasingly nervous Jack backed away in her hand towards her wrist but there simply wasn’t anywhere to go, she was currently sitting on the edge of the bed suspending him at least fifty feet to him above its surface a fall he wouldn’t like to contemplate.  
“Time to introduce myself, my name is Kara not Brenda as they call me”  
Kara surprised Jack how did she know the nick name?  
“Kara um pleased to meet you I think…How did you know they called you Brenda? Where are you from? What are you going to do to me and the others you captured before?”  
He began to run with many questions and Kara simply raised a long solitary finger twice his height and waggled it as if to say stop which he did in an instant.  
”All will be revealed my pet. You are mine now and we will be spending a long time together and you will get to me know me intimately I assure you”  
Her words seemed to imply more than he wanted to accept for now which increasingly made him nervous.   
“Please tell me what this is all about?”  
Jack looked pleadingly into her eyes and seemed to strike a reaction.  
“Seeing as you are so perfect I will explain to you little one”  
Moving Jack closer to her face still her every word washed across him with the freshness of her cool breathe.  
“First of all I’m not an alien despite what those other little men may have told you. They think that they are so smart yet they are dealing with someone who’s technology is light years in advance of theirs. I have ignored them and their pathetic efforts so far but I have intercepted some of their communications recently and learned a lot about them. You know they really think they could capture me, I mean Jack how on Earth would little men like you manage to secure a woman like me. I’m a giantess to all of you, although it might be fun to let them try and tie me down though”  
A smile crossed her face as she was sidetracked with a thought and then she continued.  
“I’m a normal every day Earth girl Jack, only I’m not quite as microscopic as you little guys used to be”  
“You must be over seven feet tall that’s not normal for a woman and what do you mean used to be?”  
“Seven feet tall”   
She laughed   
“That’s not even as high as my ankles would be”  
Jack was lowered to the carpet before the bed as if she was trusting him yet he was also very worried that she might want to step on him like she had the car.   
  
Seeing Kara from the floor was another experience as her legs seemed so impossible to him as they rose like thick fleshy columns from those black high heels and converged what seemed over a hundred feet above him underneath the canopy of her tight skirt. Drawn as he was to look at her commanding presence he also thought about the possibility to escape but where could he run? With one step she could overtake him at full sprint and block him with those wall high leather shoes in any direction and she knew it.  
“I want you to take a good look up at me Jack. You see how towering I am now compared to you? Well where I come from if we both stood at our normal respective heights you would still be looking up at me this way and perhaps a lot worse because you are tiny Jack, all men are tiny compared to me”  
This was hard for Jack to comprehend questions flooded his thoughts as he looked up at her finding it difficult to believe that a woman could be so tall.  
“Last time I measured myself when I was sixteen years old I stood about three hundred feet tall give or take ten feet. My inside leg measures close to two hundred feet but I’m pretty average for a woman”  
Her boast was confusing and begged more questions from Jack but she launched into more explanations before he could ask.  
“You see Jack I’m not an Alien despite my advanced technology and size, I actually come from your future centuries from now”  
What a revelation Jack found it hard to believe yet it was more palatable than accepting the existence of Aliens.  
“I’m a business woman, 22 years old and highly successful running one of the largest family retail chains in the galaxy and you are going to become my most successful product ever”  
Now Jack was lost in confusion.  
“Wait your saying you are from my future and your just a business woman, why would you come back in time for me I still don’t get what this is all about?”  
“Good question little one. It’s about supply and demand, about making money and about fun”  
A smirk fell over her face and she lent down to reach for Jack providing him with an eyeful of that deep cleavage as gravity took her full breasts for a few seconds, it was an attractive sight at any scale but mind blowing to a man as small as Jack because he could really appreciate the volume of her giant breasts from the outside.  
“A little overwhelming am I?”  
Kara smiled as she picked him up once more noting the attention he was paying to her top she wasn’t at all shy to point this out.  
“Its ok little one you will get used to being in the company of giant women like me. Where I come from women would all be giants in your eyes and if you think these boobs of mine are big you haven’t seen anything compared to some of my bigger sisters. You see men in my century don’t exist and haven’t existed for many centuries, women populate the entire planet…”  
“Only women?”  
Jack said half intrigued finding Kara very intoxicating despite the fact that her attraction pheromone wasn’t working on him.  
“Only giant women Jack, millions of beautiful giant virgins waiting for a little man to play with”  
Suddenly Jack felt very insecure he was beginning to realise where this was all going, he was a captive of this gorgeous blonde who wanted to whisk him somehow into the future to fulfil the desires of giant women like her and just how could a woman that size play with a man as she put it? He began to think this future sounded very dangerous.  
  
“Enough of the history lesson for now. I need to inspect my little Jack to see if the chase was worth it. Time to undress”  
Kara delighted in watching Jack squirm in her hand he didn’t want to remove his clothes but he wasn’t sure he could deny her if she forced him.  
“I said its time to take off your little clothes tiny”  
She repeated a little more firmly and then added  
“You must learn to do as a woman tells you if you are going to get along in my world. I know the women you encounter here don’t have authority over you or indeed the power to back up their instructions of you but I have. Perhaps if you are reluctant to shed your clothing Jack I can oblige you may even enjoy me undressing you”  
Jack was laid prone on her hand and held there as a large grinning face rose over him followed by a long pair of clear finger nails each the size of a large shovel that delicately tore at his clothes. Sliding a nail beneath his top it was ripped open exposing his muscular chest. It was reaction for Jack to protect himself but his arms were instantly restrained by a thumb and finger. He was shocked at how weak he was and how easily overpowered by her mere fingers as she stripped him like a toy doll in her hands. Her treatment of him wasn’t rough it was amazingly gentle considering her size and how small his garments were and it was as if she was well practised at this task but then he recalled the others before him and how she had left the unfortunate Sean Boardman’s clothes on top of the half finished skyscraper. Jack imagined Sean may have been laying in her palm just as Jack was now whilst she stripped his clothes away suspending him hundreds of feet above the city.  
  
Once Jacks main clothes were removed he watched Kara drop them on the bed below in a tiny bundle all except his boxer shorts which he currently retained.  
“You wont be needed these anymore, Ill just shrink them out of existence”  
She said as her ring once more performed and his clothes vanished which was kind of a chilling sight for Jack as he wondered if she could simply shrink him out of existence. Turning back to Jack Kara placed him down upon the vanity area which was a plain wooden surface with little more than a large mirror and an electrical point for a hairdryer upon it. She sat in the chair trying to fit her amazon legs under the surface so she could stare down at Jack still from an intimidating vantage point given how high her body rose over him even at this reduced level.  
“Now the underwear Jack I want to see just what you have down there for me”  
“Look Kara, please can we not talk about this? You seem very intelligent….”  
“Are you shy Jack?”  
Her voice cut in ignoring his question.  
“You know I could remove your little shorts quite easily and you are powerless to stop me”  
A giant hand laid down on the table inches away from Jack , it was flat but covering a very large amount of the surface from sight reminding him of her power it possessed as it innocently rested.  
“Give me your little shorts now I want to see you naked, I want to see your little treat Jack present it before me”  
“But…”  
  
  
   
##Part 7  
  
He began to speak however Kara tapped her fingers down on the desk and he not only heard the soft taps thudding on the surface he also felt a slight vibration across the wooden top something only a tiny person would appreciate.  
“Now Jack I wont ask again little one just obey me”  
Jack really didn’t want to give in to her, he had never been so humiliated as he felt right now before her eager eyes. In a split decision he decided to run and sprinted across the large wooden surface without thinking through his actions. In a blind panic he made for the edge focusing on escape but before he had covered more than a foot in reality her hand slapped down like a solid wall barring his way as he crashed into her wrist failing to stop. He scrabbled to his feet backing away and saw another equally big hand closing towards him from the other side. It was then he recalled the sub dermal homing beacon in his leg and he slapped his thigh to activate it figuring he had nothing to loose. He hoped someone would be able to save him before this situation got any worse.  
“You are athletic its fun to watch you run like that Jack but there is no where to go. By the time your little legs move you I simply have to reach for you with my giant hand and you are mine. Perhaps I need to teach you a small lesson Jack come here”  
Her hand managed to clasp around Jack and held him in darkness for a few seconds. Then he found himself approaching a pocket upon the back of her skirt and he was dropped inside its accommodating depths until he was held firmly within it against her firm rear end. The opening of the pocket was way out of his reach and for now he was trapped. However this temporary accommodation was designed to allow her hands free and when they next took hold of him he was lowered to the surface once more but could see a huge black shoe standing there with the high heel facing towards Kara. Not a word was said as she delicately wrapped something thick and rope like around his body securing his arms at his sides and then he was positioned half way up the heel with his back facing it whilst Kara tied the bonds that held him to it. As her fingers pulled away she marvelled at her handy work and Jack looked up and down to find himself secured to her high heel several feet to him off of the surface below so his legs and feet dangled. Above him that same heel stretched up over him by a long distance. He was stuck and could not move his upper body despite all of his strength. It was then that he noted the rope around his chest and stomach, it was blonde in colour the same as her natural flowing locks, she had obviously plucked a long hair from her head and its silky length provided a thickness that challenged his muscles to break. In fact he couldn’t free himself and he was at her mercy secured to a woman’s shoe of all things.  
“Let me go! Please!”  
He cried out worried about what she would do next.  
“How cute you look against my big heels Jack. Now where was I? Oh yes I was going to check out your little manhood its time to impress me”  
  
A long finger came towards him with a giant thumb for company and gripped the top of his boxer shorts in a giant pinch between two shiny nails. Slowly his boxers shorts were peeled down his legs until they hung at his ankles and then dropped below. Unable to cover himself he was fully exposed to Kara who rested her chin down on the table in order to get a good look at what he had to offer.  
“That’s so small, by far the smallest I have seen on a little man but then you are the tinniest little thing that I have had the pleasure of shrinking. But I guess to the little women in your life it’s probably a good size. Don’t worry you haven’t disappointed me because it’s what’s inside it that counts tiny one and that’s what I must test”  
The pad of a giant probing finger touched against his six pack and then down his shaft and between his legs it felt good as the large nails gently dragged on him. Jack felt so vulnerable and yet he enjoyed the touch of this giantess a fact he couldn’t deny.   
“Lets see what it takes to turn little Jack on shall we? You know Jack all the little men I have taken find me attractive, do you like what you see Jack? Do you like your women with long smooth sexy legs?”  
  
Kara stood up and he could see the very tops of her thighs as they disappeared beneath her short skirt, she raised a leg upon the chair and he could see the skirt shift back as almost her whole inside thigh and lower leg was displayed. The shape was exquisite there was definition of every muscle yet she wasn’t muscular in any way, the legs were firm and the skin was flawless and deeply tanned. Even to his little eyes they betrayed no hairs he could distinguish and they looked incredibly smooth.  
“Maybe I could pick you up Jack and run that little naked body of yours along these great big legs of mine would you like that Jack to see how extremely long and smooth they are?”  
Jack began to fight the blood that was flowing to his southern regions this woman was getting to him but he didn’t want to give in and further declare his weakness to her.  
“Or maybe you aren’t a legs man Jack? Maybe you like a little rear only mine is far from little”  
Kara took her leg from the chair and then moving the chair aside she turned striking a pose that pushed her pert backside towards Jack so he could see under that short skirt due to the angle she presented and he could see the elegant curve of her twin cheeks separate by what appeared to be a giant lacy thong. She pushed her hand under her skirt and pulled its hem higher still to reveal more of the curvaceous outline and Jack was in serious trouble now. He tried to think of anything that would destroy his enjoyment of the view, this woman had a killer body beyond any one he had ever encountered it was almost perfection and amplified as it was with her giant proportions it just seemed even more gorgeous to gaze upon.   
“Still not getting there are we Jack, you wouldn’t be trying to resist me now would you? Men like you can resist a beautiful blonde like me, especially with this body of mine. Mmm how about breasts Jack, does a nice pair of big tits get little Jacks blood pumping?”  
  
He knew what was coming as Kara turned around once more she lowered herself towards him and ensured her chest hung forward filling and expanding her tight t-shirt with the rounded forms of her ample bust and allowing her open neckline to once more express the collision line of those mammoth breasts beneath.  
“You looked so small in between these earlier Jack and you are still so very tiny compared to them now. Look at how they could smother you so easily Jack.”  
He watched her hands caressing her curves from outside pressing into the flesh which overflowed even their great capacity. Now his manhood was rising beyond his ability to control. Seeing her actions were producing the desired effect Kara pulled off her t-shirt and her breasts the size of two small houses bounced before Jack in a white lacy bra that took over his vision with its presence.  
“Ahhh it looks like you have a weakness for big boobs which is perfect because you are just the right size compared to these, see how big they are Jack? No? You can’t see, perhaps a little closer so you can really feel every bit of your tiny ness”   
The huge white bra which swung before him and closed in on Jack seemed to grow in size as it came nearer. The vast white exterior of each gigantic cup was detailed in a pretty lacy pattern but in between the swirling lines the soft mesh like structure behind was almost translucent allowing him to see the tanned flesh beneath and the darker skin of her massive areola half outlined. The shadow her body caused fell over him and he watched each of those projecting breasts travel aside him and the back of the shoe as he was centred between them.  
“Do you like that Jack? Do you like feeling surrounded by them, suffocated between my giant boobs, does their enormous size turn you on Jack? I know it does, you really enjoyed it when I placed you in this bra, but you wanted more didn’t you Jack? You wanted me to pick you up and slip you right inside one of these soft cups, to be under my bra so I could press you lovingly against my massive nipples. That’s what you wanted isn’t it Jack to be helpless to my giant breast and trapped in the softness of my giant bra. That’s the sexy place little Jacks tiny naked body wants to be”  
  
Her words were hitting the right note turning him on with her wonderful seductive tone and Jack was overwhelmed once more he felt small, he felt tiny and she was so enormous, those breasts were so impossible and sexy in proportion to him that he could imagine how easily she could slide him in one of those bra cups just as she teased. As Kara gently rubbed the very edge of her breast against his whole body he felt a trembling in his dangling legs the start of an uncontrollable reaction taking place. Her left breast and the whiteness of the bra cup bumped gently into him nudging the shoe with its weight and touching against his hardness with a soft embrace. Kara pulled away knowing the inevitable was happening right there and then and Jack felt his manhood produce wave after wave of his hot sticky juices. Her fingers tip were suddenly there to receive what little amount he had ejected and she lifted then up to wipe any extra onto her fingers.  
“I think someone down here loves a giant pair of boobies now I know the secret to get you to produce this wonderful stuff”  
Kara smugly announced as she smiled down at him knowing she had found his weakness, Jack just looked on feeling the falling bliss of his enjoyment as it ebbed away and he watched her standing back up. She turned her back to him and he saw her skirt being hiked up from each side as her hands must have been reaching into her underwear. It looked as if she was playing with herself but it only took a second or two before she was bending over stabilising herself using the bed as if her knees had given way. She then flung her head back thrashing around what looked like seventy feet of blonde hair in a reckless manor as she screamed out with joy. Jack wished he could cover his ears from the booming voice of her shrill cry but apart from his temporary discomfort he was astonished that she was having an orgasm with such intensity.   
  
For a few seconds she fell onto the bed and lay there panting to recompose herself before she turned with the widest most gigantic smile he had ever seen. Half breathless and with a flushed face she loomed over him and struggled to speak at first between breaths.  
“That was the ultimate! I’ve found paradise and it’s you Jack my special little Jacky doll”  
Her hands untied him removing him from the shoe as she took him to her large prominent lips and smothered a wet kiss upon him in gratitude. This was a very pleasant sensation for Jack as her lips pressed onto his entire chest and nether regions before they withdrew. If he could have managed it he would have been erect once more but it was too soon after his release.  
“What just happened?”  
He said dumbly and Kara sat down on the bed with him placing his body on the surface of her skirted lap as she put her top back on covering that magnificent chest.  
“It’s called an orgasm Jack a fantastic amazing orgasm. I’m going to take great care of you little one”  
Struggling to stand on the giving surface of her skirt Jack managed to get to his feet and then tried once more to extract the information from her that he needed to understand this crazy situation.  
“Kara, now that you have had your fun with me can you at least tell me what is going on here?”  
“Mmm I think you deserve to know especially as you will be entering my world soon and you must be prepared for your new life. Tell me Jack have you noticed women in your time right are getting taller with each generation? Inch by Inch rivalling the men around them? Ever noticed teenage girls are becoming taller than the boys of their age?”  
“No I can’t say that I have but then I’m very tall for a guy I don’t pay much attention to women’s heights well I didn’t until I got caught up in all this”  
“You don’t look very tall stood on my skirt down there, in fact you look a little lost”  
Kara teased  
“Thanks to you”  
Jack replied with a little hint of frustration at his condition but not wishing to rile his captor as he so wanted the rest of her explanations.  
“Women are getting taller around you Jack, each year just a little more bit by bit and it will only begin to get noticed by the year 2030. You see right about now in your time an average woman stands a meagre five feet and four inches depending on her nationality and men somewhere between five foot nine and five feet ten inches tall. By 2050 the average young woman in her twenties stood eye to eye with their partners some were even taller. This changed the whole social balance of life women began to assert themselves a little more and men found themselves less sure of their position in life. By 2150 an average woman looked down on the nearest male their height and growth patterns seemed to be increasing at a faster rate, a ten year old school girl could put a fully grown man in the shade and an adult woman would expect to become at least eight feet tall. This was becoming a serious problem for men and society because houses had to be built to accommodate the new women and it seemed that the female of the species was becoming more and more dominant we were starting to take over in a natural fashion simply because we weren’t the weaker sex anymore”  
“I don’t believe this”  
Jack paced across her skirt finding small creases to step over its otherwise smooth exterior.  
“Believe it Jack because by the year 2230 men and women faced a serious problem, reproduction without medical intervention was becoming impossible. The populations of the world dwindled and nations reduced in numbers by this time women stood over twenty feet tall and men found themselves living in an outsized world where they became second citizens unable to perform manual labour and to work machinery and vehicles of this increasingly larger world.”  
“No that can’t be the future”  
“Why not Jack, its just natural selection women were destined to exceed men and that’s what has happened the weaker of sexes is man and unfortunately its inevitable that all men will have to fit into a world where women are not their equals, to look up to us and to rely on us for everything. But you see the world hit a critical phase and science had to intervene to save the human race. With the population at an all time low a new cloning technology was devised that could from a sample of body fluid artificially grow a new life. But it only worked on women, cloning the men proved unsuccessful at first and soon 90 percent of the world’s population were female. With the last remaining handful of men the process of cloning them was discovered but a little too late. By 2400 sometime in that century women acquired heights of sixty to seventy feet and the cloning became difficult to sustain with their rapidly growing statures reducing the number of new members to society as once more the human race shrunk in numbers. The cloned men at this time found themselves walking amongst giantesses and trying to live in the growing cities around them. Needless to say they were fragile and many died from horrible accidents under the feet of the giant women around them life was a constant challenge for men to fit into the woman’s world”  
“Sixty foot women? I find it hard to swallow Kara”  
“Even though you have seen me a lot larger?”  
She grinned  
“Sixty feet was nothing Jack by the turn of the next millennium women finally stopped growing and we settled somewhere around an average of three hundred foot tall like myself although I’d like longer legs. Anyhow over the next few centuries with our heights stabilised we rebuilt our cities to accommodate how we have evolved and there is practically nothing left of the little world you see around you here except for in museums or protected public areas and such where a limited amount of it survives. But men became extinct unfortunately a long time before this despite the cloning of them they proved too fragile to coexist in our new world.”  
“Fragile?”  
Jack questioned wondering if he could walk onto her knees that were extending out of her skirt and perhaps slide down her extended leg to the ground.  
“Accidents Jack, can you imagine if I sat on you as big as I am now or you ended up seeing the underside of my great big shoes over there.”  
He shuddered at the thought.  
“Men kind of naturally dwindled in numbers the cloning pool of genes dried up and for centuries women have learned to live without them bringing us up to my time 3815”  
“You’re kidding me”  
“I don’t lie Jack, it’s the truth. Women in my era can hardly recall what a man is, they can’t imagine a day when they shared the Earth with an opposite sex.”  
  
Kara went on to inform how science had progressed how disease was a thing of the past and how peaceful it was, technology had conquered everything but boredom and the blandness of their existence was becoming more and more a problem. History records had not been kept easily with the fact that as women grew over the centuries the size of storage devices had to be constantly kept in parallel transferring data from new medium to new medium which ultimately saw much of this data lost forever.   
“So the world is populated by three hundred foot plus cloned women who are bored with life? And I suppose you now get your kicks by time travelling to grab little men for your pleasure”  
Jacks tone was a little off but Kara let it pass she was quick to defend her actions.  
“My family is in business Jack, I’m continuing the family business we are the largest suppliers in the retail sector we have been changing our society creating new interests. You see Jack space travel is open not only to the scientific and research community in my time but its common place for the privileged to acquire private space transport. Many of the wealthy find entertainment in travelling the galaxy and exploring new worlds, which brings me back to my older sister who founded my company. Sky was interested in exploring space and she found a worm hole an anomaly in space that no one had reported. Secretly she sent remote operated probes through worm hole and to her astonishment it transported the probes to the past, back to your time Jack”  
  
  
   
##Part8  
  
Suddenly jack noticed a noise which distracted both of them. It was coming from the built in wardrobe.   
“Looks like we have company Jack have you been a naughty little boy?”  
Her hand grabbed him and she held him inside a large fist with his head just poking above the skin as she walked to the wardrobe and pulled it open to reveal a bag. Opening the bag on the bed it was filled with various devices Jack could only relate to hand held computers yet exceptionally small ones. One of them she retrieved was emitting the alert. She held it up and looked at the small holographic display screen. Upon this marvellous display that was created in thin air he could see Agents entering a building obviously the hotel where they currently resided, the homing beacon despite its reduced size had worked and Jack couldn’t help but smile that maybe with her reduced size they would have a chance of subduing Kara and rescuing him. Kara held Jack out in her palm so he was flat and ran the same device over him which bleeped in response.  
“I should have been more careful you have been a naughty boy Jack but don’t worry I’ve just neutralised the signal.”  
“Kara they know where you are they’ll search every room in this hotel until they find you and a seven foot plus blonde doesn’t exactly blend into the crowd believe me”  
“I wouldn’t want to blend in Jack but don’t worry I can handle our little visitors, its time to change outfit I think”  
Kara looked out of the window, they were only a few levels up and she spotted a woman crossing the street dressed in business attire consisting of a dark suit and a cream blouse. Using a device from the bag she pointed at the woman and then to herself. Instantly Jack watched her clothes alter transforming before his very eyes. Her skirt lengthened growing from a figure hugging mini into a knee length formal skirt, her t-shirt became a silk blouse and pointing at her shoes they became shorter two inch high heels of a different style. Slipping her feet back into her new shoes she admired in the mirror her trim figure and the new look. With the long sleeved blouse tucked into her skirt it pulled nicely over her chest and emphasis it’s more than ample size.   
“You like Jack?”  
She posed for him showing off her curves in the new clothes looking like an amazon business woman or a giant secretary in Jacks eyes.  
“Its not going to fool them Kara you cant hide your unique size”  
”Your are right Jack It’s impossible for me to get any smaller and I’m uncomfortably minute as it is but I just wanted a new look and another fashionable outfit for my collection just before we leave”  
“We are going? Where?”  
He suddenly didn’t feel so comfortable.  
“To my spacecraft of course and back to the future and you can ride in comfort Jack do you like my new blouse?”  
Jack was suspended in her fingers as she dangled his naked body above her new shiny silk blouse it had a more conservative neck line that the t-shirt but still she produced a very large cleavage display.   
“It should be nice and soft for you in my little blouse pocket, right up here on my breast Jack where I know you’ll enjoy the ride”  
  
Before he could say anything she lowered him into the opening of her little pocket as she termed it only this was a deep pocket many times his height and several times his width and didn’t warrant the term little in Jacks current appreciation. He felt the silk surround him and it did feel surprisingly sensual as it surrounded his skin with its smoothness but the feeling of her bra pattern making itself noted behind his back reminded him of just where he was in her pocket and on the top of her breast.  
He hoped the agents would search Kara when they captured her and discover him although it would be embarrassing to be seen so helpless that he couldn’t escape a woman’s blouse.   
“wow you are tiny in there Jack you’re just a little bump on my boob”  
She giggled and shook him around in the pocket just for fun to watch him slide around. There was nothing for Jack to hold onto and he bashed around into the soft material as her breast jiggled his body this way and that. Kara then turned to practical matters and packed up her various gadgets into a larger case at the base of the wardrobe so she only had one item to carry. Inside this case was a mass of underwear which she laughed at whilst she sorted out the large bras from the matching knickers and stockings onto the bed. Closing the case she left these articles out and then reduced the case with her ring until it was tiny enough to slip into the back pocket of her skirt. There was a rough knock on her hotel door and a man’s voice beckoned.  
“Hotel management”  
“Oh what a poor effort how uncreative”  
Kara muttered loud enough that Jack could hear.  
“Do come in”  
She responded   
“It’s unlocked”  
  
A man entered dressed in a bland suit and saw the stunning blonde sat at the vanity table fixing her hair up into a pony tail, his eyes drifted to her long legs struggling to be tucked underneath.  
“Hello Miss, sorry to disturb you but we are just checking in on our guests it’s just a small survey if you would be so kind?”  
“Sure I’m always pleased to help”  
He boldly walked in shutting the door and looked as if he was assessing the situation as his eyes roamed the room around him nothing was out of place.  
“According to records you checked in at the beginning of the week?”  
“I certainly did”  
“May I ask if you are in town on business?”  
“You could say that yes, big business”  
She smiled and he saw a great flash of white teeth gleaming his way. Jack wondered if he should call out and shout for help but realised his little voice probably wouldn’t carry from the pocket and unpredictable as Kara was he waited to see how this would pan out.  
“And your business would be?”  
He urged her to clarify  
“Lingerie, ladies underwear as you can see”  
Her hand gestured to the clothes on the bed as she finished tying up her hair.  
“I see, is anyone staying with you?”  
“Oh just my little boyfriend”  
She smoothed over her chest and Jack felt those fingers pressing him briefly into the firm yet giving breast behind him for a second.  
“And is sir available to speak to?”  
“He’s a little indisposed I think he’s up to his neck in women’s fabrics for our business getting the true feel of them. Listen I hate to rush you but is that it?”  
“Well um”  
The man paused for thought racing to find an excuse to stay he hadn’t seen Kara but from the reports this beauty seemed to fit the bill.  
“Are you satisfied with your room madam is it comfortable?”  
“Actually I have a problem with the bed if you must know”  
“Oh really?”  
“Yes it’s far too small”  
“Small?”  
The man approached towards the bed close to Kara as she sat watching him.   
“Well for me that is, you don’t seem to cater for us girls with very long legs”  
Kara chose her moment to stand up and the man was shocked as he found himself looking up at this leggy beauty who was a full head and shoulders above him. Trying to retain eye contact he gulped down hard and stepped back he knew this was the target they were seeking because no woman he had seen was so unnaturally tall.  
“Far too small for lovely long legs like mine don’t you think?”  
He stepped back and needed to raise the call on the radio in his pocket, was she on to him he wondered? Was she playing along with him? His orders were not to engage her but surely he could overpower such a woman, she was a female after all.  
“You are strikingly tall”  
He admitted thinking he should begin to backtrack out of the situation.  
“Statuesque and towering I think is what you are looking to say.”  
Kara loomed over him straightening up to ensure she gleaned every inch of her height advantage.  
“But it also must be very challenging for you to be such a tiny man”  
The man gave a strange look he wasn’t short by any means of the imagination although he certainly felt it before her exceptional frame. He backed away wary of her as Kara stepped forward closing the gap intimidating him.   
“I’m not tiny”  
He countered.  
“Really? You look like you would have trouble climbing out of this bra to me”  
Kara picked up a black padded bra that was laying on the bed and held it towards him.  
“What are you talking about…?”  
  
The man was beginning to loose his cool the situation was getting weirder by the second and suddenly he decided to bolt for the door as he simultaneously reached for his radio. Turning his back to Kara he was at full speed shouting into the microphone.  
“Targets in room 407 go!”  
But he kept running and running. Surely he would have reached the door by now? He looked forward and the door seemed a long way off with acres of carpet stretching before him and it was at this point he froze realising the door and room itself had suddenly become gigantic! Fearfully turning around he was in time to glimpse two colossal legs rising way above him just as darkness fell all around. Kara had casually dropped her spare bra over the tiny man having reduced him as he fled and now his entire body was caught under the massive dome formed by a single bra cup.  
Plunged into darkness he scrabbled to find his way out but Kara was already upon him with her hands, she gently squeezed the generous cup gathering the shaped material in the firm moulded cup and collapsing it upon her prey. The tiny man didn’t know what was going on until he found himself turned over at a dizzying pace and held in the bottom of the cup with its great walls of dark material surrounding him like an empty swimming pool. He ran around inside it barely three inches tall from his head to his toes and totally freaked out by finding himself in this giant bra held in the hand of a giant woman. Jack listened on as he shouted and realised the man was shrunk and shook his head he wished he could see what was transpiring out side her pocket.   
“Just as I thought you are a small little man and you’re stuck in my bra”  
She watched for a few seconds as he attempted to climb the sides only to slip down the surface into the middle each time. Laughing Kara placed the bra down on the vanity unit with the cup still inverted and she made for the door.  
“Time to go Jack”  
Her voice boomed down into the pocket with a smile and Jack caught just a glimpse of her lips moving above before the pocket swayed with the rhythm of her chest in motion to her steps.  
  
Outside the hotel door three similarly dressed agents brandishing firearms raced down the corridor to see the distracting long legs of Kara stepping out from the door.  
“Freeze lady!”  
The lead agent commanded as the all stopped several metres away striking poses that trained their guns upon her.   
“You got me”  
She smiled at them and raised her hands. Cautiously just the agent who told her to freeze stepped forward covered by the other two. He told her to turn around against the wall and she did so willingly with her hands against it. As the man stood behind her he was surprised to see her size up close. Reaching for his handcuffs to restrain her he looked away for a second onto his belt trusting his colleagues to cover her.   
  
In those fractions of a second when he had turned back to face her it was a much different sight. His eyes levelled off with her curvaceous hips and with the back of her large black skirt in his face, he glanced down to see her legs were as tall as his entire body. This was a sexy rear that faced him offering the perfect womanly shape and the large split in the back of her skirt revealed more than enough bare legs to get any mans blood pumping. In the other direction the back of her cream blouse rose up and up and was covered in a trained of blonde hair hanging down her body from her head way above. But this man hadn’t been reduced in size he still stood five foot ten inches tall but Kara had grown to over twelve feet doubling his size and taking advantage of the tall ceilings. Meanwhile Jack was suddenly aware of her growth as the pocket enlarged around him and he sunk further down feeling even tinnier than he had moments before. The agent kept a grip on the situation and commanded her to put her hands behind her back whilst he cuffed her.  
“Oooh and I thought you were going to frisk me but I guess you can’t reach for that, so you like hand cuffs eh? You like tying women up?”  
Kara was being suggestive once more but the professional behind her reached over his head trying to see if the cuffs would meet the enlarged circumference of her wrists when those wrist seemed to raise even higher! She was now brushing the ceiling with her head reaching fifteen feet tall.  
“I haven’t got all day what’s keeping you shorty are you going to tie me up or….”  
She turned around to find him almost under her skirt hem and laughed.  
“…or am I going to tie the three of you up?”  
Kara folded her arms in a smug manor and looked down over her heaving bosom at the man below. Before he could act she picked him up in her arms like a little child and he dropped his gun as he struggled. The other two agents advanced and warned her to put him down which she did dropping him from several feet to the floor and back onto his own feet. His reaction was to draw back and collect himself scrabbling for his weapon.  
“Make yourself shorter right now lady or we will be forced to shoot you”  
The man instructed loosing his patience with her games and a calm Kara slowly reduced back to her seven foot plus amazon like form.  
  
  
##Part 9  

Forgoing the cuffs they simply pointed their guns at her and urged her to the lift opposite. All four of them entered the lift and Kara stood between them looking down at the three men from her lofty stature she still had a grin on her face she was enjoying the game. As the doors closed on the lift Kara then knelt down and the agents questioned  
“What are you doing stand up now!”  
“I thought we could talk better like this you guys are rather short and it does hurt my neck to look down at you all the time I thought this might even things up and give you little guys less of a complex of how short you are”  
“Just be normal ok I won’t ask again”  
They didn’t know what to say but she was almost as tall as the three of them in this position. As the lift dropped a floor the men started to notice Kara was expanding, she was growing larger and beginning to fill the lift. First her knees pinned one of them to the side wall whilst her backside cramped the other which left the third man finding himself pressed by her shoulder. It all happened in an instant and Kara now continued to fill the lift with her size squeezing against the men as she lowered her head and arched her back in order not to hurt herself. None of them could move to fire a weapon and her big body had them all plastered against the walls.  
“I’m so sorry I just can’t get to my normal size there simply isn’t enough room in here it’s rather cosy don’t you think guys?”  
There were some muffled noises and then Kara continued seeing the lift was about to end its journey  
“What shall I do? I know how about I shrink all three of you that would make some room”  
Kara used her ring on the man before her knees and he instantly disappeared from sight reducing herself she still kept the other two fixed to the walls with her body parts as she shrunk them in turn.  
Quickly she returned her seven foot realms and stabbed at the lift buttons to keep the doors from opening upon the basement floor, she knew there may be more men waiting outside. Hitting the button to return to her floor she then looked down at her feet hearing the tiny cracking sounds of gunfire, her knee felt a small sharp pain and she was getting annoyed with them now. The terrified little men all no larger than four inches tall stood together in the corner of the lift and saw her stamp on the ground with a shoe many times larger than them. They all fell over with the violent vibration of her action and before they could recover two large hands larger than the scoops upon a monster digger closed around them.   
  
Jack was still being buffeted around he knew things were not going right and that Kara had the upper hand once more but there was nothing he could do. The men found themselves seconds later dumped unceremoniously upon a mega sized bed she had taken them back to her room. Kara loomed over them filling the sky with her giant form and simply knocked the guns from their hands with her fingers in one easy action. They tried to run in all directions but none of them could jump or climb down from the sheer drops either side of the bed. Holding their tiny guns in her hand she broke all three weapons one by one between her thumb and forefinger a display of strength these men all witnessed as they continued to look for a method of escape.  
“You look like you’re into pantyhose little man”  
She grinned and swiped one of them into her hand catching him in mid run and then dropped him into a pair of stockings she had left on the bed surface. He fell what seemed a long, long journey to the base of that stocking and he was trapped as she balled it up around him and placed him on the vanity table to keep his previously caught colleague company who was still desperately trying to scale the sloping walls of her giant brassiere still. Turning to the remaining two men she watched as they tried to scale the pillows at the rear of the bed in an attempt to distance them selves from her.  
“Well it’s been fun playing with you guys but I really must be going. Now I’ve only got a pair of knickers left so you two will just have to share them”  
Lifting a cotton pair of knickers Kara dropped them down onto one of the men and the material captured him with ease. As she watched the small bump of his body running under the soft material she gathered him up inside it and then grabbed the final man placing him in the generous material and wrapped them both inside it. Pulling the material around them both and tying it into a knot she place the neat little bundle onto the vanity surface with her other prisoners and then stood over them and smiled down.  
“Don’t you all look so cute in ladies underwear, but you know something guys if you are all going to try women’s clothes on make sure they are in your size”  
  
Walking away Kara laughed to herself at how wicked she had been teasing them and left the room. Entering the lift she made for the top floor of the hotel and exited out onto the flat roof. Jack could feel wind entering the pocket and sensed the fresh air he knew he was outside now.   
“Want to see something impressive Jack?”  
  
Kara plucked him from her pocket and into her soft hands and he could see over the side of the building that there seemed to be a commotion below at street level consisting of emergency services vehicles arriving to cordon off the area presumably from the agents instructions. She was trapped on the roof and he wondered what she would do. She crouched down and he saw her touch a finger to the back of each shoe in turn.  
“Wondered how come I can be so light on my feet Jack? How my giant shoes don’t always leave huge footprints? Its a neat technology that uses AGM to counter my weight it’s not perfect but in situations like this it can be most useful.”  
“AGM?”  
He didn’t recognise the abbreviation.  
“Anti gravity magnetic’s little one but then that’s probably beyond you, you see three hundred foot women sometimes need to walk in more delicate areas where we would destroy the landscape if our true weight was expressed like when we visit the little pyramids and such.”  
“But you’re not a giantess at the moment?”  
“I’m holding you right now in the palm of my hand and I was just carrying you around in my blouse pocket here and you don’t think I’m a giantess sweetie?”  
She laughed and he noted her clothes glowed for a second as presumably she was once more shielding them from view within her invisibility technology, Jack never saw her activate this nor did he see her activate her ring with a physical button or switch it was as if she could just summon her changes in height and the powers she seemed to posses.  
“Well you are a giant woman to me but….”  
“But you want to see me grow larger that’s just what I had planned. Its back in this big blouse for you I need to get big”  
Kara smiled dropping him into the safe keeping of her bust pocket and then she began to rise. With the pressure of her weight on the building countered by her technologically advanced shoes she rose to three hundred feet in a matter of seconds and her shoes spanned almost a quarter of the hotel roof disturbing some antennas and crumpling the toe section of her shoes against some ventilation structures. As some more agents came out onto the roof she simply stepped off of it and her long legs allowed her to stride a fifty foot gap in order to step down onto another flat roofed hotel nearby. Like stepping stones she walked across three more buildings and couldn’t resist stepping into a large open air swimming pool situated at the top of one such building to watch the tidal wave of water that spat over the sides of the building and down onto the late night pedestrians below. Kara used some smaller buildings like a stair case to lower herself to the street level and a quiet area of the city with huge open park land. Looking around there was only a couple of vagrants nearby and no one to take notice as Kara revealed herself.   
“I want you to see this little guy”  
Her voice was thunderous to Jack and he was almost frightened to hear her speak at this size.   
“Hold onto my hair”  
  
By this time Jack was lost in the seemingly endless world of her blouse pocket as a one inch tall man her pocket was in the region of twenty feet wide to him yet now she had returned to normal it was vast and impossible in dimensions for him to calculate. A solitary hair was lowered down towards him guided into the pocket and soon this cable thick blonde strand found him and he clung onto it surprised by its diameter. Kara of course couldn’t feel his connection having negligible weight to her but having left the solitary hair in the pocket long enough she slowly drew it upwards in order to raise him above the pocket opening. This was a long distance to travel for Jack as he slid along this silky wall going higher and higher with hundreds of feet of material passing his eyes until he was over the canyon like pocket and looking out at what seemed thousands of feet in the air to him. Kara hoped he had a tight grip and didn’t wish to place him in danger as he dangled on her hair over the safety of her pocket which would catch him should he fall.   
“look forward little Jack our chariot awaits”  
She dramatically boomed with that thunder present even in her lowered whisper, she wanted him to see the unveiling of her colossal spacecraft as its form emerged from its previous invisible cloak.   
  
But at first unbeknown to Kara Jack wasn’t paying attention to the spacecraft as it revealed he was more struck by Kara’s body and namely the jaw dropping spectacular way her blouse extended beneath him. Her breasts had become a mountain range and he was awestruck at how small he was compared to her womanly figure that surrounded him in nearly every direction. Every slight shifting of those mega breasts beneath the silk exterior was exaggerated by her current size and like watching a landmass happily jiggling away in an unstable fashion. When he finally looked up her spacecraft was there in entirety fully exposed for all to see and it looked miles high and miles across to Jack. It was a sleek craft in the expected saucer shape apart from its nose which held and elongated section. It hovered its hull perhaps thirty feet from the park below anchored in the air by unseen methods.   
“Entrance”  
Kara said and the craft seemed to split in half at the front lowering down a ramp for her to board. Deciding Jack had seen the view and was notably impressed she lowered the hair she had offered him back into the safety of her pocket. She then walked into the ship which in scale to her was about the size of a large double level coach. Once aboard she made the short distance to the cockpit and sat herself down inside a comfy chair. The engines were silent when they took off and it surprised Jack that he couldn’t perceive any sound except for the noise Kara made sitting in the chair. Two minutes went by and it was the early hours of the morning that the ship streaked out of the Earth’s gravitation and into space.   
  
After ten minutes Jack felt a jolt as her breast wobbled his world.  
“Hyperthrust engaged now we can relax my little spec of a man”  
She went to tap her pocket but then thought better of it in case at her current size she mushed him against her boob he was far too valuable a cargo to allow a little accident like that to happen.   
Jack meantime was pondering on the situation he felt insignificant to this beautiful creature who kept him in the deep and dark recesses of her blouse knowing his every hope of being saved had vanished he wondered what would become of him as he entered the future that Kara had outlined.  
As he sat there feeling unsettled her blouse began to contract around him. It didn’t close in by much but it was noticeable in the result.  
“Climb onto my finger nail tiny”  
Kara instructed and a huge finger offered him a massive upturned nail to step upon she was still enormous despite her reduction in size. Lifting him carefully out she placed him down upon a glass like display console and let him step off the nail. With her ring pointing his direction he began to enlarge until he felt huge in comparison to his previous dimensions.  
“That’s better I can see your handsome little body now”  
Kara said with her still giant finger tracing down his body.  
“In case you are wondering I made you around four ten inches tall a touch smaller than your normal height for a reason”  
Jack looked at her and noted even as large as he felt she was still phenomenally big.  
“And you are?”  
“I’m short only just over a hundred feet I had to shrink down and with me the entire spaceship in proportion minus my precious cargo”  
Turning around Jack saw a display screen hovering in mid air showing stars rushing past as an alarming rate it was amazing.  
“Wow I’m really in space but why aren’t we weightless?”  
“There is artificial gravity in here tiny you wont float away its only in the dark ages people bobbed up and down in space, this is just like riding in a car.”  
“But why have you shrunk the ship and yourself I thought you were normal size before I don’t understand”  
”Lots of questions eh? Well we have some time to kill whilst we journey. I mentioned my clone sister before who discovered the worm hole, well she sent back these remote operated probes through it that could digitally image items that we can replicate back home. You see life on my world was stale with only a few distractions like sports and such to amuse us. Over the centuries our clothes became bland and uninventive just practical and efficient but my family’s business breathed life back into the retail market by taking the retro fashions of your era Jack and bringing their colours and styles back to our time. They startled women and kick started an interest in clothes that had lain dormant in our very jeans for so long, fashion was back and we had a window on the past to keep pumping out new designs and building up our profits. Now women shop to look good it’s almost competitive and amuses the ladies in my time to have a new interest. We have spawned a whole new look for women which for the last couple of years now they are just lapping up. But you see Jack when my sister stood down from the company to retire I took over and I was let in upon her secrets.   
I saw the worm hole for the first time and it’s more of an anomaly than it sounds because its virtually undetectable unless you are on top of it and unlike other wormholes that have been recorded this one is small in the amount of space it actually occupies which is why only probes had been sent in the first instance, my sisters ship and all average ships like this are far too large and would be crushed if we attempted to take a full sized human through the vortex.”  
“So you used the shrinking technology of your time to adjust your ship and yourself to get through”  
“Half right my mini man, the stone in this ring I wear is unique. In my time shrinking and growth technology doesn’t exist, my sister by pure chance found a comet that came through the wormhole the first time she discovered it and a fragment of that comet broke off and imbedded itself into the hull of her ship. When she had the heat shielding fixed this unusual stone was found and we didn’t know what it did until Sky analysed it in the lab. Its strange properties are harness by the micro electronics in the ring band that she had constructed it uses a neural interface for activation just like most of our modern technology”  
“neural? You mean mind control, wow I am from the dark ages”  
“Don’t bother your pretty head about it Jack you don’t need to be clever you just need to look good and perform well from now on and of course behave yourself”  
Jack didn’t like the connotations from her words but whilst he was getting information out of her his keen detective mind kept pumping for more.  
“So your ring is one of a kind then, not common place in your time?”  
“That’s right so only I can enter the wormhole and bring back such wonderful treats from your century and after reinventing fashion I was curious about men. Women have survived so long with out you little guys and sex is just so bland with just our artificial aids for company. That’s when I thought about a new product line for my retail empire”  
“You are going to sell me? As a sex toy!”  
Jack suddenly piped up alarmed and Kara smiled with her full lips framing those perfect pearly whites and picked him up in her hand running a finger between his legs and around his tiny manhood”  
“No I would never sell you Jack your going to be my original, you are my little treat dispenser and all mine and talking of treats have you recharged that wonderful little orgasm giver?”  
“Look Kara in my time men and women have to consent to having sexual relations”  
Kara took Jack in her hand and walked through one of two sliding doors into a small cabin area consisting of a single bed and little else. Placing Jack down on top of the covers she made sure he was looking up at her and that she captivated his full attention.  
  
“In your time Jack men and women have to consent to sex because they are practically of equal size. But I’m a lot bigger than you in case you haven’t noticed Jack, I’m a giantess and that means I can have sex with you when ever I please. Some one as tiny as you could never resist a giant woman who is horny Jack because as you rightly said you are but a sex toy to a big girl like me to play with”  
Jack stepped back a little wondering if she was going to take him by force. She was right, there was little he could do to stop a giant woman who wanted satisfaction her fingers alone could overpower him as he had already experienced. But her demeanour altered as she sounded a little softer in her voice and more seductive.  
“But I think my little sex toy will consent to sex because you find me so attractive don’t you little Jack? Am I not everything you desire in a woman? Is this not the most alluring figure you have ever set eyes upon?”  
  
  
##Part 10  
  
Crouching down Kara began undressing removing her blouse button by button making sure Jack was almost in her blouse as it was opening up to reveal her pretty bra and gigantic breasts beneath.  
Trying not to be weak Jack looked away across the bed and attempted to focus his thought and vision away from her beautiful body. But Kara wasn’t having any of his attempted resistance to her charms as she removed her blouse she circled it around Jack bunching it up like a thick white wall twice his size until he was inside a u shape with only one direction to look and that was straight at Kara.  
  
Next she stood up and her skirt was edged down her tall thighs. She took great delight in wiggling her curvy hips out of it bringing her skirt close to the edge of the bed so Jack could feel the rush of wind as it slid to her ankles in a pool of material. With the height of the spacecrafts cabin style bed Jack was almost level with the white g string that Kara was wearing and through the decorative lace patterns he could see evidence of her well trimmed blonde bush behind. Suddenly he was thinking how enormous this woman would be, her pussy would be quite imposing behind that lacy barrier and just the thought of its size to him was intimidating enough. Stood in just her under garments Kara posed for Jack swaying this way and twirling her figure so he could lap up every unflawed region of it from all angles.  
“I tell you what little one, I won’t touch you unless I can get approval from that little treasure between your legs. If I can make it rise then it’s telling me that I have your full consent but if I fail then I promise to leave you alone no matter how hard that would be for me to resist.”  
  
She didn’t wait for Jack to agree to the challenge and simply launched into a full onslaught of her best tactics to raise his interest. As she sauntered over to the very edge of the bed once more she released her long silky locks for a few seconds letting the full glory of that natural blonde hair dance upon her body shielding her chest for a few moments before she whisked it away with the flick of her head revealing her chest as if two golden curtains had been drawn. Jack was entranced by her he couldn’t help it he was but a man and seeing a woman of these proportions teasing him was hard to resist not to lustfully stare as breasts the volume of small houses bounced gently in the air above him. Kara lowered down until Jack was once more very close to her cleavage and tilting her mammoth bra forward she breathed her seductive words over him trying to temp his arousal as she exhaled swelling her flesh within the straining lacy cups until they threatened to overflow.  
“You like seeing these up close don’t you Jack? You like how small you are to them, you love how small you are to me, you like being small to a beautiful woman”  
  
Slowly he watched her edging the thick shoulder straps of her bra over her tanned shoulders, should he look away to save himself? He couldn’t he was a man and it was impossible to ignore her and so much of her! The bra was peeled away and it dropped with an audible yet gentle thud to the bed before him. Briefly he was distracted by its presence because it was an outrageously large piece of women’s underwear that faced him with such an abundant amount of lacy material still holding its curved form due to the enormous under wire in the each of the cups. He didn’t need to imagine the amount of breast flesh that it would take to fill such huge cups as the tonnes of heaving bosom now loomed over him unrestrained and fully exposed casting great shadows upon his tiny form. Kara moved back enough to present these tanned orbs before him with her nipples pointing down at Jack each thicker than his whole head. From this range he couldn’t look at both of these nipples at once and had to turn his head to gaze at each of them in turn.   
“Look up little man these are one hundred percent natural giant sized breasts, mmm they feel so firm Jack and so heavy.”  
Her hands roamed her breasts tweaking at the already aroused nipples making them stand even more to attention. Jack had never dreamed a woman could be so enormous that a man couldn’t hope to ever take her nipple into his open mouth but here was such a woman defying everything he knew with her sheer size.  
“I know what you still want Jack, you want me to pick your tiny naked body up in my hand don’t you? You want me to place you in my gigantic cleavage here and feel these giant breasts all around you. I can see it in your eyes little one you want to be surrounded by a pair of sexy giant boobs like these”  
Her words and actions like she used before were doing the trick triggering a response from Jack that was natural and unavoidable. Still Jack kept quiet and tried to desperate hold back his appreciation of her but nature was too powerful to be denied and his salute to her beauty rose hard and fast betraying him.  
“Oh Jack, I knew you would give yourself to me little one and now you are mine with full consent”  
“Only the consent of what’s down here between my legs Kara, It’s not right to use me like this I am a man”  
“Ah he has a little voice at last, you will find that this little teeny brain between you legs knows what’s good for you and right now he’s hungry for some giant busty babe to take him into her cleavage and swallow him all up”  
  
Without further word Kara’s breasts landed with soft thuds either side of Jack placing him in the middle and crushing down the blouse wall that circled him and then those towering walls of flesh started to move inwards. Jack saw no way out and couldn’t avoid being plastered gently to the giving softness that now encompassed his complete being. Compressing her breasts inwards using her hands she lifted his helpless body up sandwiching him for a few seconds plunging him into darkness as she laid herself down on her back on top of the bed. When Jack was freed he was disoriented to discover he was laying down at the base of two mighty breasts which curved out and rose either side of him. They were so tall he could no longer see the nipples upon them from his current position. He had enjoyed those few seconds of her lovely flesh touching him like it had all over his own bare exterior and now he was highly aroused as he stood up and surveyed her bodyscape. Her body was breathtaking a spectacular smooth plane only interrupted by the valley of her hill sized breasts and the subtle rise of her knees and feet way off in the distance. As small as Jack was he felt even smaller looking how far she extended away from him it was like standing on the deck of an oil tanker and looking in wonder at how much area it covered only this was a far more shapely environment.  
“wow”  
A simple comment passed his lips but one that encouraged Kara.  
“Let yourself go little one, go on explore me. We have to get to know each other because you are going to be mine for a long time to come, you will soon know every curve of this body better than your own”  
It was a testing moment for Jack, on one side he knew that loosing all resistance to her charms and putting himself under her spell he would find it hard to break free. His police mind told him this woman was a criminal he should stop from interfering with the lives of those men she had already captured and his own life, she was a kidnapper after all. However on the other side she was gorgeous and the way she intimidated and handle him generated sexual feelings he had never felt before, she was also very gentle and hadn’t physically harmed him. It was an inner turmoil he was facing to decide if he should indulge himself and explore her body as she enticingly suggested, his throbbing member pointing skywards screamed a healthy yes and he was soon walking around the curve of her left breast before he knew it.   
Reaching out his hands touched the base of that breast depressing into it with his fingers slightly yet he was too small to shake her mighty breast or even move it at all. It felt warm and smooth to the touch and before he knew it he was rubbing himself below against her tit a breast that with both arms expanded wide he couldn’t challenge the width of. Kara cooed down over him with surprise at his action.  
“Oh Jack that feels nice but I would like to see you my little toy, come out from behind my breast it adds to the excitement”  
He realised she would have lost sight of him due to the high rise of her breast and he complied by stepping one more into her cleavage to see her delighted blue eyes smiling upon him.   
“Climb me Jack”  
She looked at her breast and the small man beside it and figured he could manage to scale her with some effort on his part. Tensing up she couldn’t wait to feel his little hands and feet contacting against her more sensitive skin knowing it would be divine. By now Jack was forgetting his earlier reservations and walked up her cleavage towards her slender neck. He could just notice her huge lips smiling as he then turned to face the top slope of her breasts.  
“Left or right tiny which will it be?”  
Kara taunted playfully and he could feel her very words transmitted through her chest. Choosing the left breast he walked up the first few feet sensing how curious the terrain was as it gave to his foot falls. Then the steep incline of the slope forced him on his hands and knees before he tried to actually climb. Despite the steepness he managed to crawl onto the top of her breast and the first sight to welcome him was her thick nipple and the darker skin of her areola beckoning him to the centre. Jack played with her nipple taking it between two hands and caressing it like a large breast as he straddled the nipple with his legs keeping his arousal pressed up against the shaft of the nipple.  
Kara was drawing sharp breaths to his actions her nipples were sensitive and his little attentions were generating big results as she felt herself become exceeding moist between her leg below.  
“What an absolute joy you are Jack that’s terrific so terrific!”  
Her voice boomed out. As Jack stimulated her perched on her hill like breast he looked back and became aware that her fingers had descended into her knickers in the distance, she was playing with herself to increase the pleasure. Watching her hand moving beneath the lacy confines of her underwear he was so distracted that his hands slowed on her nipple.  
“Oh Jack I need more, please don’t stop little toy that’s so good and I will reward you”  
Her voice urged him and he complied as he felt her free hand pushing him into her nipple so it was tight between his legs and Jack almost began to hump against the shaft. This didn’t last long as Kara took him in her hand and then smiled as he was hovered over her face.  
“I need your seed little man, come and make love between these big sexy lips of mine”  
  
She held him so his inches fell into the gaping abyss that was her mouth a wide cave that his manhood was lost in as it rested on a plump pillow thick bottom lip. But then Kara closed her mouth and paid attention to the small toothpick that she felt between her lips tightening her grip upon on it and covering Jack’s balls and most of his midsection along with his full erection. Those moist painted lips were pure bliss to Jack as he felt so taken by her and he began to bang away at her with a rising energy making love to her giant mouth through those luscious giant red lips.   
“Oh my, oh……oh!”  
He began to feel the onset of his own impending orgasm mere seconds away and then just at that crucial point in time Kara pulled him from her lips and he watched as her body rushed underneath him flashing past as he travelled in her hand through her cleavage down her stomach and then arrived at her knickers. Her underwear had been pulled down enough to reveal the other hand working its own path to enjoyment. Her womanhood was larger than Jack would have guessed yet given her size it was perfectly in proportion, he just couldn’t have pictured female genitalia at this scale.   
Without a word Kara slipped his legs into the left leg hole of her knickers so he was pressed against her giant inside thigh before he was lined up in order that his mid section was kissed by her wetness. He could feel her sex spanning from his lower chest to his thighs and his manhood dropped into it with ease. If it hadn’t been for her hand that positioned and held him his hips might have been sucked into her along with his middle. The sensation of her wetness pressing against him and her lace underwear snapping over his legs and back keeping him in place was too much for Jack. The erotic smell so strong and overpowering combined with his current helpless position pressed against her most intimate of areas which happened to be so giant sized made Jack burst inside her. As his juices flowed into her Kara was suddenly reacting like he had flicked a switch inside her brain sending her the message that this was pure sexual ecstasy. Her hands withdrew in an instant and he was then completely covered by the lace of her knickers as she writhed around like a mad woman. He could hear her jubilant cries ringing out in his ears for many seconds and then afterwards they had died into small murmuring soft whispers of joy.  
“So, so good”  
She said quietly and Jack lay there trapped in her underwear feeling totally drained.   
  
Now with the commotion of her giant orgasm settling he began to crawl out of the tight material that held him, he pushed up the elastic lined waist band of the knickers and slithered out onto her lower stomach just below her deep navel. Kara’s eyes alight with glee greeted him as she stared between her giant breasts.  
“You see Jack being my little toy isn’t that bad after all. I think we have some wonderful times ahead I can’t wait to do this with you every night”  
“Kara Ill admit that was something else and you are well in a word…wow…. but lady I don’t care how big you are I am not anyone’s property”  
“You are a cute little thing when you try to assert yourself, but just take a look around and see how tiny you are. You are soon going to enter a woman’s world Jack, my world where I’m going to be even bigger to you than I am now. Its time you faced that you are my property and that’s forever little one.”  
“Don’t I deserve to know why?”  
“That little detective brain of yours doesn’t switch off now does it? Ok Ill humour you”  
  
Putting Jack down he watched her dress once more covering her lovely body. As she finished dressing she smiled at him as her outfit suddenly glowed and altered. What had been a skirt and blouse transformed into a short summer red summer dress complete with matching wedge style red sandals.  
“That’s better now I promised you an explanation to stop that little brain of yours working overtime. So hop into my hand sweetie and I will reveal your future.”  
Stepping into her hand he was lifted up and then deposited into her cleavage once more and secured so his body was firmly held at the base of the low cut neck line enough that he could look out as they travelled.   
“I like carrying you this way little man and it will be even easier when I return to my full height”  
Trying to steady his view from the sway of her chest Jack watched the small link corridors of the space craft rush past his view until they entered what was labelled as the med lab.   
“Now before I show you the other men I have collected I need to explain your purpose Jack. I am in business as I’ve explained. The new fashion market is a roaring success and it’s swelling my company profits day by day with these authentic retro designs that I’m bringing to the future from the past.”  
“What a minute, why would people purchase clothes when they can just record them and switch outfits like you did before?”  
“Good question tiny, the answer is easy. The holo imager I have is like a modern day camera to you, lots of people have them in my time but perhaps not as expensive as mine. But interfacing the records of an imager to clothes isn’t general access technology. You see my clothes here are the next generation a prototype if you will. There are literally billions of micro nanobots that are programmed to emulate any outfit I tell them to or they can conceal the outfit and its wearer with holoprojections that render me invisible. Like most of modern technology its all thought pattern controlled, I cannot release this to the general public or they wouldn’t buy my outfits its business plain and simple but we digress.”  
  
The room around Jack was small with just a few hologram style interfaces hovering which seemed to be medical equipment of some type. He watched Kara pressing thin air activating something until he saw what looked like a small pot materialise on a metal surface.  
“I mentioned our cloning abilities to you Jack and how giant women are cloned to expand the population in a controlled manor of course. That’s why we are all flawless Jack, perfect female specimens free from disease and imperfections of any kind, and it’s this same cloning that I wanted you for. You see I’m going to keep you as my original but I need to replicate your wonderful physique for all those sex starved giantesses who will pay a fortune to get their hands on a limited edition mini man.”  
”You’re kidding right?”  
“No far from it Jack. You see I have done a lot of market research the first men I brought back 2 years ago went down very well whilst they lasted and through a small network of close trustworthy colleagues I will hand out some of the new men I’ve just acquired but the ultimate product will be you my little Jack doll. You will be replicated and delivered to thousands of women so they can have their wicked way with you and experience what I have just moments ago.”  
A pair of long fingers hoisted Jack from her chest and hovered him over the pot of cream he looked down a little alarmed.  
“What are doing?”  
“Don’t worry little one this will feel great I assure you”  
His body was lowered into the pot and he felt the cold cream surround his shape covering him up to his neck. Apart from the coldness it did feel very nice around him.  
“Sorry little one but you will have to hold your breathe for a moment”  
   
   
##Part 11  
  
Her warning came seconds before she pushed down with one finger tip on each shoulder until he dipped under the cream and was covered from head to toe. Before he could panic the same fingers took his now slippery form into her large left palm and he expected her to clean him only the cream seemed to gently sizzle all over his body. This hot sensation was pleasurable like being gentle warmed and it was as if the cream simple evaporated and disappeared leaving a small tingling on his skin before he felt normal again.  
“What was that?”  
“Evo-plastic-durabond”  
“Come again?”  
“It’s part of a two stage process that will make you….”  
Kara smiled a cheeky sort of smile  
“…it will make you more durable and less fragile for us big girls”  
What she meant by this Jack could only guess.   
“Now we will finish stage two when we reach the development lab in my offices. This is enough of a treatment to sustain you for hibernation”  
“Hybernation?”  
Kara pushed him back down into the neck of her dress and tapped him playfully on the head.  
“I have to get you through customs clearances or there would be a lot of explaining to do”  
She wasn’t making any sense and as he remained a passenger in between her breasts he waited for her to clarify exactly what she had just done to him.  
”Little men like you are very fragile Jack, you might think you are tough but in a giant girls possession you would suffer if she got let’s say a little enthusiastic and wasn’t so gentle”  
“So this stuff you put on me makes me stronger?”  
“Well when we finish stage two lets just say you will be ready to be handled as vigorously as any woman could desire”  
“You can’t be serious Kara”  
Jack suddenly envisioned Kara using him like a living dildo and was worried about his own safety.  
“Trust me, when you are finished Jack I will be able to pop you inside me and let you wiggle around down here and I wont have to worry about my muscles clamping down on you and breaking you, you wont even suffocate as easily.”  
“No”  
He said and Kara laughed.  
“Oh you wait until tomorrow Jack when this treatment is complete and I spread these big giant legs of mine and open wide for you. There isn’t any man who couldn’t honestly say he wouldn’t be intrigued to venture inside, frightened maybe but interested all the same”  
  
Kara walked into the cargo hold and Jack looked on in dismay things seemed to be getting worse and worse for him and there was no evident way out of this situation. He was to become a sex toy and to be replicate a thousand fold for giant women who shared Kara’s hunger for pleasure.  
“I don’t get a choice in all this do I?”  
His voice sounded weak but Kara was very chirpy with her reply.  
“You must learn to enjoy yourself Jack and let go of how things used to be. Then you will find living as a toy is just as rewarding to the toy, its nice to be cared and looked after. I think you are so precious Jack we will become very close in time. You will ride in my clothes pockets or right in my cleavage if you prefer going where ever I travel, we will spend evenings and nights of pleasure together and promote the sales of my little man companion during the day it will be a wonderful life for you Jack.”  
Jack wasn’t so convinced but didn’t wish to counter Kara whilst her spirits were so high. As they walked around some large cargo crates in the hold he questioned more.  
“Kara if I am to become this general doll for all these women then why capture the other men and the ones you took to your time two years before?”  
“My first endeavours with little men were not successful”  
She sat down pausing in her search for something and became a little more sombre in tone.  
“The little men I took those years ago, my first little dolls were well received by my close   
colleagues. We kept them secret and cared for them like little pets but one by one they met with unfortunate accidents. None of them survive today and I do regret that, really I do.”  
Her face was sincere and even welled with tears as Jack was taken from her cleavage and held in her hands.  
“None survive, but what happened to them?”  
“Accidents, pure and simple Jack they weren’t ready to be plunged into a world of giant females. I took ten in all, one for myself and nine to test with my closest of colleagues. People I could trust not to leak their existence to the authorities of our time. My little man I accidentally stepped on, I didn’t mean to it was horrible.”  
She swept a tear from her cheek and Jack didn’t know whether to be horrified or feel sorry for her.  
“I told him to stay in the bedroom as I got changed for an evening out. I was wearing some high heeled sandals much like these and he followed me into the bathroom. I just turned and stepped on him there was nothing left under my sole it was horrible, just horrible”  
She held back her tears and cradled Jack in her hands protectively.  
“The other men found similar deaths all accidental. One was sat upon by Jennifer she didn’t mean to, little Eric suffered a worse fate as he fell from my friend Anita’s bikini top he didn’t stand a chance from that height poor little devil. Then there was Joe he was a climber, he so loved to scale his owner Mandy but he did it once when she wasn’t aware, holding onto her long hair when she turned and he was flung against a wall. The history is not a pretty one the longest survivor died over a year ago he drowned inside Tamzin she couldn’t get him out fast enough”  
Jack couldn’t believe his ears was this to become his fate? Some horrendous accident beneath Kara’s feet or worse?  
“But don’t worry Jack we learned our lessons and in the year of planning we perfected that cream and a process you will soon undergo on our return it will avoid any such accidents occurring you will be protected from harm by us larger folk and the bigger world you will live in. Don’t worry about it you will be cared for Jack and you are safe with me”  
  
Kara placed Jack on the box she had rested upon and knelt down to find a box beside it.   
“Now here they all are”  
She smiled and clicked open the box to reveal its contents. Inside was a mass of cartons the sort you would purchase a child toy inside with a see through front panel. The words upon each one read “Animated life the real doll collection”  
Kara gently picked up one of the boxes and a Barbie style doll in a fashionable outfit was staring out with her fixed expression. Kara opened the carton and placed the doll beside Jack standing it upright and he was face to bust with this statuesque plastic beauty.  
“Look even my little dolls are taller than you Jack”  
He looked at the doll staring over his head with her fantastically decorated features. She actually looked very realistic compared to dolls he had seen in his time almost too real.  
“Ill let you have one of these to sleep with if you are a good pet Jack she has artificial intelligence you know, she not a dumb blonde. Let me show you”  
A switch was flicked inside the long blonde hair of the doll and suddenly she was standing by her own power and counterbalancing herself.   
“Please tell me my name?”  
The doll looked up at Kara.  
“Your name is Little Kara”  
“Hi, I’m little Kara pleased to meet you, what shall we play today?”  
Kara laughed at the sweet innocent sounding voice of the doll and Jack was quite impressed as he walked around it noting it was transfixed on Kara and hadn’t noticed him below.  
“We are going to play mummy’s today and if you look down you will see your new daughter”  
“Oh goodie, I love playing mummy’s.”  
The doll looked at Jack and smiled leaning over towards him. He felt stupid as he reactively checked out the gaping neckline of the dolls bust revealed by her current position.   
“I will call you Sally. Sally you are not dressed?”  
The doll looked up at Kara  
“Do we have clothes for Sally?”  
“Of course”  
Giggled Kara and she reached into the box to grab some small clothes.   
“These are far to big I will have to shrink them down for little Sally”  
She said reducing the clothes with her ring and handing them to Little Kara.  
“Time to get dressed, would you like mummy to dress you Sally?”  
“Kara that’s enough I’m impressed ok?”  
“I didn’t understand your answer. Would you like mummy to dress you in these pretty clothes Sally?”  
“No”  
Jack put his back to the doll it was annoying him now.  
“Kara”  
He called but she was too busy enjoying the show.  
“Sally is a naughty girl she isn’t doing what she is told. Come here to mummy right now”  
The doll loomed over Jack with its height advantage and placed a rather strong seeming grip down upon his bare shoulder.  
“Hey!”  
He snapped and shrugged her hand off stepping aside to distance himself from the big doll.  
“Better do as you are told little man she’s a lot bigger than you”  
Kara grinned watching the doll tower over Jack and reach out its arms to lift him off his feet.  
Jack wasn’t ready to feel its hands under his armpits and especially not to feel his feet leave the ground.  
“Woah put me down!”  
He shouted   
“Now!”  
“Sally is a very naughty girl mummy will have to spank Sally”  
Kara was in hysterics as the doll forced Jack over her knees sitting down on the surface and pinning his bare back side in place. All of the dolls actions were part of the AI personality it had been given and it interpreted Jack as a smaller doll it was supposed to interact with. Her power was amazing to Jack and her grip like iron he couldn’t break free and was subjected to her a humiliating spanking as her mechanical hand slapped his rear three times as she repeated.   
”Bad girl”  
When he was released he touched his rather stinging rear which from a backwards glance had a full perfect replica hand print of the dolls palm crossing his cheeks in a red section of skin. Jack rubbed his rear and felt outraged he jumped up to reach for the dolls off switch and the doll interpreted his action totally differently. He was trying to disable the doll but she thought he wanted affection.  
“Its ok Sally mummy will cuddle you”  
She held Jack in her arms and hugged his face to her hard breast which was only fractionally giving. Soon he was settled to his feet again as the doll instructed that she would dress him once more.   
“Just give in Jack”  
Kara laughed   
“She won’t stop”  
Jack ran around the doll and leaped up to her hair managing this time to avoid her embrace and flicking the off switch rendering the doll as lifeless as it had originally appeared.  
“Oh you spoil sport Jack that was fun”  
”Not for me!”  
He blasted up feeling his rear still tingling with the after effects of the dolls hand.   
“So how do you like my interactive dolls pretty lifelike eh?”  
There was no reaction from Jack.  
“I thought I could get her to dress you but it looks like that’s down to me and you can’t switch me off little man even if you could reach my head”  
Kara grappled with an unwilling Jack and soon began to slip some dolls clothes upon him, initially he fought her but soon realised he wasn’t winning as the clothes went on so he relaxed.  
“Oh how pretty in pink you are”  
Jack ended up stood in her hand wearing a very girly pink dress befitting a girl of maybe seven or eight years complete with long socks and black shoes.   
“Now you can really be my Sally doll”  
She laughed and reached down into the box for an empty container shorter than the rest that was waiting for a smaller scale doll.   
“You will go in here for the rest of the journey little one”  
“What! No, I won’t be able to breathe, Kara please”  
He begged but Kara softly spoke in a calming voice.  
“Look Jack, I will level with you. I have to smuggle you guys in through the space port customs they don’t let us bring back any living matter from space without it undergoing analysis and I don’t want anyone realising I have some new arrivals.”  
“So you’re a smuggler now as well as a kidnapper and I’m soon to be an illegal alien”  
“Jack its not like that…I can clone little pets under license. I’ve done it with tiny animals many times and made products of them, little men will be no different except for their popularity of course. I just cant reveal how I obtained workable DNA as they will find out about my worm hole which simply cannot be allowed to happen. You see all I have to say is we found some preserved DNA from a frozen source and suddenly we have the license to sell little toys like you.”  
“What if I don’t go along with this?”  
  
  
##Part 12  
  
“Jack do you have a choice? I think that you realise by now there will be no way back, also you must realise I am in charge of you. You need me now Jack, if you reveal what I have done you will find yourself the property of the state and who knows where you will end up? Others might come back from my time when they learn of the wormhole and who knows what they will do? Giant historians traipsing around causing mayhem or there are those who will see this wormhole as a threat to the timeline and then all hope of you future return may be lost”  
“Ok I get the picture”  
“Good, that’s a good little pet. You will join my other pets hidden in here”  
Kara lifted out several boxes containing identical dolls such as the one he had a close encounter with and then opening one box as an example she slid out the small doll which was strapped to a cardboard backing strip.   
“Look”  
She ensured Jacks attention as he noted the dolls appeared flickering much in the way her clothes did when they altered her outfit. Suddenly there was one of the men from his files staring back at him dressed as he was in a dolls outfit.  
“That’s Sean!”  
“Oh is that his name, well all of them are in here. I’m just using my nano technology to project a holo illusion so his face and body looks like a girl doll and when they scan my cargo it will mask his tiny bio signs this is how I took the last men back and it works a treat. Customs think I’ve been showing promotional stock to some of the outer rim space stations colonies and here is the perfect way to smuggle you all home”  
“But he’s dead! He’s not moving”  
“He’s in a suspended animation Jack another trick of the nano technology to lower his life signs beyond detection and it keeps these little guys out of mischief until I need to awake them. Only if I don’t pop Sean back in soon he will start reviving. So little one now it’s your turn to join them I’m afraid and next time you see me we will be safe in my office complex. You are going into this little Sally companion box, that’s why I made you four foot ten a little smaller than the rest of them Jack so I can find your box much easier. Now sweet dreams my lovely”  
  
Jack didn’t see her reaching for a wand like device on the floor beside the box as her hand took him to her lips for a kiss. As his vision cleared from her lips he was suddenly very dizzy and then blacked out. Kara had waved her device over his body and instructed the nano technology to activate using its neural interface. Suddenly he was still as a doll and she worked his little arms and legs into the little constraints so he was fixed to a cardboard slide and then secured into position within the box she had selected for him.  
  
When Jack opened his eyes he felt groggy and for a few moments disoriented. He was staring through a plastic window out upon two massive green eyes that looked upon him. It wasn’t Kara but the eyes were equally as beautiful, he went to move and suddenly realised where he was. His body was fixed by thick plastic bands suspending him inside a box with its top end opened. Looking down at his arms and legs he noticed he was still looking stupid inside the pink girly outfit he had been forced to wear. What he wondered now was who this new giantess was? Had Kara been exposed by customs was this a giant customs official? The wrapper around him was removed and he slid out onto a shiny metallic table. The room was vast and hi-tech because the whole ceiling seemed to be lit yet there was no lamps, bulbs or visible ceiling lights he was indeed in the future! A huge hand larger than Kara’s gently unfastened the bonds holding him to the cardboard. He didn’t catch sight of the giantess completely until he was stood on the table moments later. She was a beauty of equal breathtaking standards to Kara only this giantess had long dark hair and was much taller. From the table he could only see from her waist upwards, she wore a pair of dark trousers and had a simple pink t-shirt upon her yet this t-shirt was stretched over a chest which made Kara look averagely busty by comparison. As her deep green eyes settled on Jack he was greeted with a sweet yet powerful voice.  
“Hi there, you must be Jack. My name is Amber I’m one of Kara’s sisters I’m pleased to meet you”  
She offered massive little finger towards him as a gesture for Jack to shake and he did so realising he was probably shorter than that very finger in its upright position.  
“Hello Amber, where am I?”  
“Your in the one of the development labs at the moment, Kara wanted me to revive you whilst she attends to some meetings, you’ve been suspended for nearly a day. Welcome to the future”  
Nearly a whole day of his life had been taken whilst he was knocked out yet to Jack it seemed only moments ago that Kara was with him on the ship. He also realised Summer would have been waiting for him tonight and he would be letting her down but then that was the least of his worries now.  
“Thanks I think”  
“Your voice is cute, I didn’t get to see any of the men she took back last time I was too young to work for the company back then”  
“Too young?”  
“I’m only seventeen, eighteen next week.”  
She said proudly  
“But I am three hundred and ten tall and still growing, Kara thinks I might end up another fifty feet taller than her but I’m not so sure”  
“Well you look plenty big enough from down here”  
She giggled at his comment in a manor that showed she was perhaps less mature than her expressed age. But she certainly didn’t look seventeen from Jacks view point as her body was very much all woman and she could have passed for twenty years of age at least.  
“Did you revive the others can I see they are alright?”  
“We haven’t unloaded them yet, they are safe in the hold of the space hopper until Kara wants them delivered”  
“So you are a man?”  
“Last time I checked”  
Jack said as he sat himself down upon what looked like a flat PDA of some description. Amber lowered down onto her elbows to see Jack closer up her dark hair falling in her eyes as she brushed it away.  
“Your face is different and your hair is short, I have never seen short hair before. Will you take the dress off for me so I can see you’re thingy”  
Her request was actually rather cute Jack thought she seemed very naïve.   
“I’ve heard a lot about those little thingy’s that’s where that miracle juice comes from, sparm isn’t it?”  
“You mean sperm and yes, listen Amber I really don’t like these girls clothes I’m dressed in but I don’t want to be walking around butt naked anymore do you mind if I keep them on for now?”  
“Ill see it later then when I prepare you for the second part of your treatment you don’t need to be shy around me you know”  
“Thanks Amber, listen answer me a question will you? Why do you call my sperm magic?”  
“Because it is. Kara and my other sisters they talk about you little men in private sometimes, I don’t often have much to add to the conversations because I was too young to experience a man back when they had the first lot. Kara says that we are hyper sensitive, yes that’s the word she used to describe how women like us react to your man juices. I hear stories how women all used to be smaller maybe even as tiny as you are, I can’t imagine being that small. But something to do with the cloning process and our current size makes us very receptive to the slightest contact with your stuff, you know when it touches us down here”  
Amber raised up and pointed down to the fly on her trousers and smiled a little bashfully.  
  
“I feel funny around you Jack it’s not like talking with a sister you make me feel so different sort of all fuzzy inside”  
It was obvious Ambers first encounter with the opposite sex was having an impact and Jack thought he may be able to take advantage of the situation if he flirted with this young giantess.  
“Are all your sisters as beautiful as you Amber?”  
“You, you think I’m pretty?”  
“Gorgeous is more the word, stunning if I’m honest”  
“I err um well, gee thanks Jack that feels nice when you say such things. Can I hold you?”  
“Sure just be gentle ok?”  
Amber bent down and picked up Jack with a very delicate action and he was now held in her fist.  
“You are so small I’ve never imagined how small men would actually be to us, the models of men in the museums are much larger than you, maybe that’s so we can see them better without getting so close”  
“Well I’m considered pretty tall where I come from”  
His comment amused her.  
“Do women in your world share such a tiny size? That’s what Kara told me, she knows everything about your time?”  
“No, I actually tower over most women I know”  
“You do? That’s so funny I cant imagine you towering over anything.”  
Amber laughed and then offered.  
“We need to go down to the use the intensity beam in the development lab for your final treatment would you like to sit and ride up on my shoulder?”  
“Sure that would be good”  
As he was lifted to this teenagers shoulder Jack grasped some of her long thick hair strands to steady himself. Amber offered a sweet smile looking at him best she could out of the corner of her eye and winked at him before they moved off. As her body set into motion he was taking advantage of checking out her chest, if it had seemed large from beneath at his previous viewpoint it now seemed to have doubled from above. This vantage point only accentuated how well endowed Amber was perhaps if she had been a normal woman Jack guessed the way her t-shirt was forced out would have equated to a 34 F cup or maybe more she certainly had no clear sight of her legs and feet and it was a substantial bra strap that Jack was sat beside as he could easily make out the two foot wide impression hiding under the thin t-shirt material upon her shoulder. The t-shirt she wore was conservative, the round neck didn’t plunge down in a conscious effort to display her bountiful assets yet due to their challenging presence the material stretched out thinly over them and pulled the round neck out enough to demonstrate that she had serious occupants underneath.  
“Must seem high up for you on my shoulder eh? I mean you are so small and all and with me being so big”  
Amber chattered and Jack was half listening.  
“Yes so very, very big…”  
He said in reply his eyes not managing to leave her t-shirt as it bounced with her strides. Amber caught a look at him and his gaze and giggled once more in a very girly fashion.   
“Sorry”  
Jack apologised for his blatant staring and retracted his lustful eyes back into their sockets feeling guilty that she had spotted him and a little worried she might take offence.  
“Don’t be”  
She grinned and their short journey had halted outside another lab door which slid open as they approached.   
  
This new room was filled with technology and looked every bit how Jack imagined the future, a clean environment with moulded plastic chairs and lots of widgets and gizmo’s displayed on the sideboards and shelving around them. It was like stepping into the computer store of tomorrow and he hadn’t a clue what it all did. Settling him down on a clear surface next to a large machine Amber took a seat in a chair before him and shifted close up so her chin and face almost rested on the side.  
Close up she was like Kara flawless without a blemish in sight and her younger face was very innocent looking.  
“Can you take your dress off now please Jack I have to shine some special light onto your body, don’t worry you won’t feel a thing but it must cover all of you to take effect.”  
“And after you will find me some clothes some male clothes?”  
“You are funny Jack, there isn’t such a thing as little clothes for men. I have a few dolls that might be your size maybe we can find something you like”  
Jack felt a little bad about stripping before this teen but realised he needed to keep her on side and perhaps to coerce her into helping him escape if that was at all possible. He pulled off the ridiculous plastic shoes he wore and the socks and then hesitantly was about to remove the dress over his head.  
“Would it help if I was partly undressed to make you feel at ease, after all it’s only fair?”  
Amber smiled as if testing the water between them to see if her offer would be of interest.  
“That sounds great Amber, we have a saying between men and women in my time. You show me yours and Ill show you mine”  
His words produced sweet laughter from her and she seemed very game for an excuse to display herself in order to see his reaction.  
“I like that saying, there’s no one else working today in this section of the building so it won’t hurt if I undress a little. Top or bottoms?”  
She proposed waiting to see what Jack desired most to view as she stood up poised to strip away her trousers or the tight t-shirt.  
“Well I do love a pair of long shapely legs Amber but on the other hand I’m a sucker for a lovely pair of breasts especially large ones”  
Amber flushed in the face a little and looked down at her chest.  
“You know these are large compared to my sisters, I have to be the biggest up top. I kind of always thought it was a burden they just get in the way but I heard Kara say for the little men like you the bigger they are the more attractive they can be, is that right Jack?”  
Her question was sweet and Jack couldn’t help but to smile up as he answered.  
“Amber guys in my world love to see a girl with a healthy sized pair up top and if you were regular size I mean as small as girls in my time you would have men ogling you like crazy with those. But as you are a giantess they are just an unbelievable size…”  
“I saw you looking at them earlier you tried to look inside my top didn’t you?”  
“Well I….”  
Jack didn’t know what to say but Amber wasn’t annoyed far from it she liked this attention and how this cute little man was squirming embarrassed by her openness.   
“Its not as if you can ignore them especially at your size these must look totally enormous. Wanna see them?”  
She stood straight up and peeled her top away letting her chest bounce out restrained by a pale pink bra which was half shiny reflecting a silk like material used for the lower cups and see through for the upper cups with some sheer pink lace.  
“Woah!”  
Jack exclaimed as his eyes attempted to take in her exposed body. Like Kara she had the same sort of thin waist that tapered in sharply from her wide womanly hips and then her upper body just exploded into those breasts which hung from her slender frame making her the exact replica of those cartoon caricatures of voluptuous women that looked so incredibly endowed.  
“So are these attractive? Do you like them?”  
Amber lowered down resting her elbows on the side before Jack and allowing her bra to tilt forward hanging down before him with cleavage bared in this revealing bra. He thought he was used to these giant boobs by now but Ambers had surprised him again with a display that was truly awesome to a man so small.  
“They are fantastic, your body is beautiful”  
He said pausing  
“and so much bigger than I thought”  
“Bigger is better right? Do they make me sexy?”  
Her innocence was unreal to Jack and he couldn’t deny to her that she was sexy.  
“Absolutely very sexy”  
She smiled pleased with his response and then reminded him of his commitment.  
“So now you can remove that little dress and show me something sexy”  
Slowly Jack took off the dress happy to discard it and show his muscular body.   
“You are perfect Jack just like the little men statues with those tiny muscles and   
Oooh that’s so amazing! Its so very tiny can I take a closer look?”  
She was referring to his manhood and Jack felt rather insulted to hear her describe it as very tiny but he knew that was a true statement from her perspective and there was no insult implied.  
“sure”  
“I’ve never seen one, a real one that is, mind if I use a mag reader?”  
He nodded but didn’t know what a mag reader was until she produced a device that was like a small hand held futuristic magnifying glass with no actual glass but a holographic screen that enlarged what she was looking at. Jack felt like a bug at the zoo being studied as he watched her sit down and move her face close up to him until her long dark hair nearly fell on top of him before she swept it back with her hands. He was semi flaccid at present and most probably due to her studying him like this, he hadn’t felt so inadequate before a mere teenager in his life.   
“It’s so intricate with little veins and all, that is so cool.”  
She put the mag reader down and asked.  
“Is that its full size? I mean it gets bigger when you are excited doesn’t it?”  
“It’s called an erection and yes it increases in size if I’m happy”  
“What makes you happy Jack? Would it make you happy if I did this?”  
Without warning she leaned back up and simply flopped her great breasts onto the surface before him and they thudded down changing shape to fill out even more width as she did so until he could only see a massive wall of her pink bra curving over him. Amber took the initiative to sweep him up into her hand and pressed him into the soft silk cup over her left breast and then slid his body around that great curve into her cleavage and then around the outside of her right breast. Her action was slow and gentle and Jack was at full salute by the time this was over and as she put him down with an expectant smile.   
“I did it! You do find me sexy, oh Jack look at you that’s so adorable it stands up all by its self”  
  
She fawned over him pleased as punch he responded in such a manor.  
“Can I touch it Jack Ill be very careful not to hurt you”  
He didn’t mind her touch and stood there braced for a large finger to stroke his length. When her finger approached he felt intimidated by the long nail and hoped she would be careful not to accidentally harm him with it, a nail that large could easily sever a limb to someone his size. With a delicate touch she used the pad of one finger between his legs and almost lifted his balls upon it. His legs were wide to accommodate the thick finger and it almost was like straddling a horse. Jack smiled nervously up at her as she marvelled at the sensation of their connection, moving her finger out from between his legs and up his shaft the pad of that finger covered his member completely.  
She tested its resistance pressing it just a little and her action made Jack step back.  
“I really want to play with your body Jack. Would you like me to play with you?”  
The answer was fast from Jack he wanted to win her over and saw no harm in using the situation to his best advantage.  
“Amber what your doing feels real good I don’t mind if you play gently with me”  
“That’s so cool Jack, lets get this process over, I can’t wait”  
Lifting him onto the base of a machine that looked like a giant microscope of old she asked Jack to lay down on the shiny surface.  
“geez that’s really cold!”  
He grumbled and shot back up to his feet the surface was metallic and against his skin it felt very chilly.  
“Sorry Jack is it uncomfortable?”  
She loomed over the controls of the device adjusting them from above whilst Jack was almost dancing around as the soles of his feet were not happy with the shiny cold surface.  
“It’s like standing on ice what is this?”  
Jack almost sprinted off the surface and jumped down rubbing the soles of his feet. His previous hardness had fallen from the shock of being subjected to such a cold substance beneath him.  
“It only Pedrolite”  
Amber could tell that he wasn’t familiar to the substance.  
“It’s a type of metal that absorbs energy, once the beam passes through you it kind of recycles back the energy to the device but when it’s active the metal does become kind of chilly I should have warned you.”  
  
  
##Part 13  
  
“I just can’t keep still on it, sorry Amber but what’s just chilly to you is down right freezing to me”  
“Cant we skip this?”  
“Sorry Jack but Kara wants you to go through with this, it doesn’t hurt and it’s for your own good because your body will be more resistant to accidents and…”  
She tailed off and changed her mind upon what she was going to follow on with.  
“…let me find something for you to lay on”  
Amber looked around and failed to be inspired until she grinned with an idea.  
“…or something to put you in”   
She said and reached behind her back. There was a clicking sound and her bra tumbled forward onto the surface so close to Jack that it hid him from her view temporarily. The cups retained most of their shape and considering they each previously covered breasts that spanned more than thirty feet across he was towered over by this pink monster made of a silk like substance. Resourceful as normal Jack climbed up on of the thick shoulder straps and saw the bare chested Amber amused at his antics.   
“Man she’s got big tits”  
He muttered to himself as he looked at her exposed breasts striking a very big presence. Reaching the top of the strap where it connected to one of the cups he looked down into its depths and added  
“make that gigantic tits”  
He slid down into the centre of the cup not appreciating that he probably couldn’t climb out if he had wanted to.   
“Comfy?”  
Amber inquired  
“A little bit roomy for me but yeh it’s nice in here very soft”  
“Good , hold tight whilst I lift you back to the machine, you shouldn’t feel the cold through that thick material.”  
He tumbled around floundering in the cup sliding on the silk as she lifted him into place. When he was under the device he saw a huge bulb like structure over head and it softly glowed over him.  
“Make sure you turn fully around and even offer the soles of your feet up towards the light it must shine over all of your skin that the cream was absorbed into”  
  
Ambers loud voice boomed from overhead and Jack did as expected. Then she slid the bra out and he was tumbled around in its interior once more.   
“That’s it”  
“I’m done?”  
“Yep, so now we can have some fun”  
“What did you have in mind Amber?”  
He got back up on his feet and tried to look as cool as he could standing and talking up to this giantess from inside her giant bra cup feeling every bit of the size difference between them.  
“I thought that I might start by putting that bra of mine back on”  
She giggled but in a more assertive manor feeling a growing confidence around this little man before her. Amber knew he liked her body, especially her breasts and despite her innocence she guessed that he might find her next action very sexy.  
“You’d better lift me out then Amber”  
Jack reached his arms up feeling a bit pathetic that he had to ask to be assisted out of her of giant sized underwear.  
“Why would I want to do that Jack? I thought you’d like to feel my boob joining you in there, here I come little guy”  
Amber lifted the bra by both straps and then moved her breast aligning it to the cup blotting out Jacks view of everything but her huge nipple and surrounding flesh closing in on him. In seconds he was lovingly smudged into her boob flesh and cradled by the silk cup on his back that moulded itself to his outline.  
  
Jack was hard in an instant and getting harder by the second as Ambers fingers gently pushed him around in the cup from the outside sliding him around her nipple.   
“I’ve never felt like this before….not like this!”  
The joyful cries from Amber echoed outside of the warm dark sensual world that Jack was immersed in and he was probably in an equal state of arousal. Could he bring her off with just his body moving around her sensitive breasts he wondered but didn’t get the chance to find out. The fingers left that were guiding him and pressing on him and then those same digits came into the bra and pulled him free and out from under the pink canopy.   
  
He could see Amber stretched out in the chair reclining back upon it and she was red in the face flushed with the excitement of the moment.  
“You’ve made me so wet Jack....so wet. I need to feel you down here as well”  
Her heightened arousal made Amber bolder by the second and she didn’t hold back in telling Jack exactly what she wanted.  
“Jack open my trousers, please can you get inside my knickers, I really want to feel you there”  
She placed Jack on top of her trousers and he bent over to find the large zipper on the hip.   
Using both hands he pulled it down flexing his muscles to do so as it took a lot of effort and his full body weight to run the zip its full course. He could now see the thin band of her underwear and knew she was actually wearing some sort of thong, but the trousers were staying put because he hadn’t released the large three foot wide button that held the waist. This was no easy task but her waist was slack as she lay back and he soon had the button undone. However trying to undress this giant woman further was beyond Jacks powers he simply couldn’t remove the trousers by himself.  
“Amber a little help with your trousers please”  
He called and noticed her eyes were half shut as she enjoyed the process of being undressed by another.   
“Stand on my belly”  
She instructed and he could see her flat stomach and deep navel bared in full moving himself to wait there whilst her hands came into action below. As he stood back he wobbled when she edged the trousers down her thighs letting them rest at her knees. Stepping forward a pair of pink skimpy high cut knickers which were held with a single large bow on her left hip now presented the next challenge.  
Jack had to wonder why these giant virgins would bother to wear such clothes but Kara must have been right when she said the clothes of his time had hit her century. He managed to reach the bow and pulled back on it holding it like a tug or war contestant with the rope thick string in his two hands. His effort eased the bow loose straight away without any of the resistance that he would have expected and as such he tumbled back unravelling the giant triangular flap of material across her sex and fell over back into her dark pubic bush. Amber giggled to see this but then gasped to feel his body close to her womanhood. Recovering Jack looked at her giant pussy it smelt strong and ready for him and was larger by far than Kara’s had been when she introduced him to hers. Carefully he stepped towards it almost knee deep in her coarse pubic forest but his slow actions just made Amber all the more desperate to feel him and without a word her fingers swooped in and he was suddenly being confronted with her giant pussy lips.  
“I want to feel you kissed by me down there Jack, covered in my love”  
She said so enthusiastically as he was vigorously rubbed into the outside of those lips, parting them and sliding up and around the periphery of her love entrance. It was now he realised what the treatment had done, he felt the warm kiss of those lips gliding against his skin but even how firm she was pushing him to her sex he wasn’t feeling any friction or pressure, rather he was now able to enjoy himself. In a few rapid movements she had really stimulated herself using his body against her and Jack was sharing the same euphoria. Her fingers then changed how they held him as she began to enter his legs into her deepness and the warm wet tunnel beyond.  
“Deeper you go Jack, that’s it first your legs. Do you like that Jack?”  
Her hurried voice commented a little breathlessly as she sat up to watch him enter her.  
“Deeper to feel your little sex against mine, deeper inside me Jack much deeper!”  
She was inserting him all the way as his watched her pussy eat his body whole and he slid totally into the warm darkness.  
Now Amber didn’t hold back he was pulled in and out of her in rapid succession. Of course he wasn’t able to fill her far from it his body was lost in her enormity but her fingers kept him pressed to her inner flesh and he was invited by her actions to rub into almost every part of her.  
It was a mind blowing sensation for Jack as his hardness rubbed into the warm wet flesh and he burst within moments of entering her and following only a few minutes of this type of contact. Amber’s insides seemed to contract and pulse around him, squeezing his body along with the fingers that delivered him. Several times she clamped down on him in a series of orgasmic contractions. But even compressed against her flesh and being completely inside her didn’t hurt him at all he was clearly more durable as Kara put it. When finally removed from her hot hole, his body was shifted up to Ambers mouth and a large tongue licked him clean which was most agreeable.  
  
“Thank you”  
Amber smiled   
“I feel like a real woman now, that was unbelievable the feeling I had not like when I use power sticks”  
“power sticks?”  
Jack questioned.  
“You know things for girls to use on ourselves private things. We can buy them when we are sixteen but they never do that for me I mean not with the rush you gave me.”  
“Glad to be of service”  
Jack smiled feeling confident and decided now was a good time to chance his arm a little with his growing relationship to Amber strengthened by what they had shared.  
“Amber, can I ask you something to get an honest answer? Do you share Kara’s vision of what she wants to do with me?”  
Positioning him on the side once more Amber dressed herself and considered her answer.  
“I think every woman should have the chance to feel the way I just felt. To miss out on that seems so wrong don’t you think?”  
“I think plucking someone from their time zone and away from every one and everything they know is wrong”  
“Then you don’t want to be here? I mean with me?”  
“Amber I like you really I do. We just shared something very great between two people but I don’t belong in your time”  
“I’m sorry Jack, Kara is trying to change our lives here all of our lives. Women, the people of this time have been inspired by Kara and the clothes she has produced it’s given us a new interest, new things to discuss and desire. Her idea to bring men back into our lives has to be a good thing and I think you will enjoy your new life, honestly I do. You will be cared for by Kara”  
“Not by you?”  
“Id like that but you belong to Kara she’s my older sister and I would be in a lot of trouble if she knew we had even gone this far. She wants you for herself but I’m looking forward to getting one of your little clones especially after just now I can’t wait. I may even get Kara to let me have two or three copies of you. I can picture it now Jack, I would be laying on my bed just wearing the skimpiest of outfits and I would let one of my little Jack dolls play in my knickers whilst the other two were playing with my nipples, oh I can almost imagine it!”  
She began to get carried away.  
“So, you wouldn’t consider helping me return to my time then?”  
Jack had to ask that question directly, he knew there was a risk but had to push his relationship with this girl because Kara definitely wouldn’t let him go.  
“I can’t. Really I can’t Jack that would mean betraying one of my sisters and…..”  
“But didn’t what we just did together betray her you said so yourself?”  
Amber took Jack into the palm of her hand moving to the far of the room by a cupboard and settling him on top of another surface that looked like a small work area.  
“I shouldn’t have but you are just irresistible Jack, my desires got the better of me just holding you and speaking to you. You won’t tell her about us will you?”  
He looked up into those big green eyes and decided it would be unwise to attempt to blackmail her into helping him in case she grew angry.   
“No, what we did was private between us”  
“I have some clothes for you Jack”  
Altering the conversation she had reached into a drawer to retrieve some tiny things.  
“We sell a lot of toys dolls, none really as tiny as you except for the sally dolls but I found these out last week when Kara said she was leaving. I saved them just for the little men who she would be bringing back”  
A selection of tiny clothes were spread out all of them for a female doll of course but Jack found a pair of plain blue shorts and a t-shirt that was also plain.  
“thanks”  
He smiled putting them on and feeling them sag on his frame it was like wearing clothes a size to big but they fitted at least with room to spare and it wasn’t a dress so at least it was an improvement.  
“Jack I’m supposed to take you to Kara’s bedroom when I’m finished she left explicit instructions where to drop you off so you are there for her return. You will have to wait for a few hours. Her dwelling is across the complex next to the main stores area it isn’t far from here”  
“Amber couldn’t I hang out with you a little longer?”  
“I’d love that but I must exercise little Timmy and I’m not supposed to take you out of this whole complex”  
If Amber was going to walk her dog jack thought it would enable him to get a feel for this new world around him.  
“Please take me with you Amber I wouldn’t be any trouble and it would be interesting to see what this future looks like, how the city has changed I don’t even know where I am in the world.”  
“You’re in New London, England the centre of the fashion industry”  
“I know London very well, please can I see how it looks today?”  
“I shouldn’t”  
She smiled and offered a hand to him.  
“But, I guess it can’t hurt if I hide you. No one must see you Jack not until the product is launched and Kara is ready, you do understand?”  
“Sure. Ill do as I’m told”  
“Where to put you? Perhaps if I tuck you in my waist band down here you can look out and it should hold you.”  
She slipped him inside the waist band of her trousers and just his head peeked over with his arms steadying his position. Amber looked at him and shook her head.  
“I cant leave you like this. If you lost your grip and fell down one of my trouser legs I might loose you.”  
“Not to mention step on me”  
Jack agreed  
“Well that wouldn’t kill you after the treatment but it also would be that pleasant either. So….”  
Amber used a nail to pull a loose thread from her waist band and wrapped it around his waist securing him to her trousers firmly.  
“this should be a safety precaution”  
“thanks”  
“Jack remember to hide if we see anyone close up ok?”  
“Yeh. I promise not to get you in trouble”  
Amber walked down several corridors and they left the complex and across a sculpted garden area, as Jack watched her immense legs striding away encased in those long trousers it was hard to believe that he wasn’t a few inches tall and that this girl was a giant. Everything seemed such a regular size around them and all in keeping with Amber. That was until he noticed the trees that barely reached her knees growing in the grass of the garden below giving away her true size.  
  
  
##Part 14  
  
They entered a brick fronted building which looked like a more conventional house to Jack except styled very differently and of course absolutely colossal in scale. But when they entered the building Jack noted that Amber didn’t even need keys and stepped into what looked like a very Spartan living room.   
“This is where I live”  
“Nice”  
“I just need to get little Timmy and we can walk him through city park”  
“Sure”  
“Timmy!”  
Amber shouted and Jack naturally expected a giant dog to come bounding into the room to greet her when he was astounded to see a fully grown elephant! He realised that women were the only giant beings animals hadn’t been affected with such growth and due to the sheer size of the women in this world he guessed it was also natural to keep pets of a reasonable scale, a dog even a large breed would be ridiculous in comparison with Amber. But somehow this elephant also looked small by her shoes as its trunk seemed to be stroking her ankles.  
“Hello sweetie did you miss me? Time for a walk little one”  
“You keep an elephant in your house?”  
Jack said flabbergasted.  
“Its not unusual they are only small and so very affectionate and clever to, little Timmy can pick things up in his trunk on my command”  
“Don’t people from your time have pets like Timmy?”  
“No, elephants are too big to have at home and too dangerous”  
Amber laughed  
“Timmy is so small and cute he couldn’t do any harm it’s not like my sisters little tigers, they are nasty little critters that snap at your fingers if you pick them out of their enclosure when they don’t want to be held. They are scratchy little things I hate them”  
“Tigers!”  
Jack was starting to appreciate these giantesses could have literally any animal from the kingdom because nothing would present a threat to someone so large, but thinking of tigers kept in some giant girls bedroom sent chills down his spine.  
  
With a harness and lead fixed to little Timmy they stepped out and walked down some enormous streets towards a park land area. Jack saw a giant woman and a daughter pass them, they were both abnormally beautiful like Amber and Kara and paid no attention to the normal sight of a teenager walking her pet elephant. Reaching the park the little trees looked more like clumps of small bushes to Amber as she walked and Jack looked down on the canopies of the trees from above noticing little birds which were like flies to Amber.  
“Hey Jack”  
Amber whispered down.  
“Ill take you to the feature in the park it should bring back some memories”  
He watched as the massive pathway which was the size of a six lane motorway led to a concrete plinth with a railing around it to stop people Ambers size climbing over.   
“Look Jack, down there”  
Her hand gestured and extended a finger so Jack could follow her gaze and he was gob smacked to see in the centre of this raised concrete circle that there were buildings he recognised. They had been grouped together like a miniature model village. There were the houses of parliament and Big Ben still all intact with Tower bridge and the London eye next to it. The eye was the only thing that challenged Ambers size.   
“Little old fashioned buildings I thought they would make you feel at home. They’ve been restored and a little force field protects them from the elements”  
“Wow its amazing”  
Jack said hardly believing these huge monuments from his time were nothing more than a centre piece preserved in a park for the giant women passing by.  
“They used to have a castle in there but one of the caretakers accidentally fell on it and they never bothered to restore it after that it was trashed. I think your little buildings were made so brittle back then. Kara tells stories about when she walks around in your time. She said its so easy to accidentally damage things without even trying to”  
“Yeh your sister made her mark in my city”  
”There is someone coming Jack hide will you”  
Jack slipped under her waist band and dangled inside from the thread his feet tickled by the top of her underwear.  
“Amber?”  
“Hey Bianca”  
“Don’t hey Bianca me where have you been I was trying to find you and your personal com isn’t answering”  
“Oh I left it at home”  
“You were supposed to be treating Kara’s pet but I didn’t find it in her room”  
“Um”  
Amber paused to think. It sounded like an older women based on her voice and tone especially with the way she spoke to Amber.  
“Listen Bianca I’m a big girl now you don’t have to chase up on me, I treated her pet and he’s fine. I did what Kara wanted and I will put him back before she returns”  
“Where did you leave him Amber you know how sensitive this all is to Kara and her plans if something should leek to the media or…”  
“He’s safe”  
“Bianca is the little man at home or…..don’t tell me he’s in your pocket or something you didn’t bring him out here did you?”  
“I just wanted to show him our world a little he’s good company and so much fun to be with…”  
”Amber what if someone sees him or you loose him? If the media got hold of what we are doing and ruin Kara’s big plans. You are jeopardising the company here”  
”Bianca he’s fine don’t sweat it, if you weren’t such a sister lover you would want to hold on to him yourself”  
“Amber!”  
The woman snapped and Jack wondered about the term sister lover.  
“Give him to me Amber now, hand him over and Ill make sure he is back safely in Kara’s room”  
A hand came in to grab Jack and snapped the thread that secured him he was then taken to Ambers face.  
“Sorry Jack, Bianca will have to take care of you now. Maybe I’ll see you tomorrow it’s been great”  
She winked at Jack and kissed him with her huge lips and Jack was dropped into the waiting palm of Bianca. Before he could get a look at her he was inserted into what had to be a front skirt pocket and felt Bianca walking off with him. Strange he thought Bianca didn’t comment upon him or want to look at him straight away but then perhaps it was to ensure he wouldn’t be seen in public. When he came out of the pocket about ten minutes later he was in Kara’s bedroom. There was a modern looking bed and furnishings and he placed on the top of a chest of drawers made of some metallic substance and now Jack could get his first look at another giantess. Bianca was beautiful and that didn’t surprise him now he knew they were all cloned, Bianca was a blonde like Kara and very close to her description in fact uncannily close. It was only her eyes and voice that separated the two, Kara had a deeper more intense blue to her pretty eyes and a huskier speech pattern yet beside these small discrepancies they were almost identical.  
“Hi”  
Jack greeted and Bianca struggled a smile as she looked down at him it wasn’t the greeting he would have expected.  
“Hello Jack, Kara has told me all about you I must say you are exceptionally small compared to the other men I have seen in the past. I can understand why she wants to use you as the model for cloning?”  
Bianca’s attitude seemed disproving and Jack locked on to this.  
“Sorry, don’t I meet with your expectations Bianca?”  
“I’m sure you are a cute and desirable little man, Amber and Kara sure seem to think so”  
“And you?”  
“I don’t find men attractive Jack no disrespect but why would I want to play with a tiny thing like you when a partner of equal size is available, someone who can hold me and really make love to me”  
Jacks look of surprise was clear.  
“They kind of get off on the reaction to my juices if you know what I mean”  
“That’s just some freak genetic thing somehow male sperm is intensely stimulating to women of my time but I’d rather have someone work at making me cum”  
“Then you’re a lesbian?”  
He tentatively asked not wanting to provoke a bad reaction.  
“That’s an old word Jack it hasn’t been used in a long time I only know it from Kara and her travels to the past but I’m what we term a sister lover which is the same thing. We are in a society of women and feelings towards other women are naturally going to occur, sister lovers have been growing in numbers over the centuries but the mainstream population still wishes to keep the pretence that our numbers aren’t as significant as they are.”  
“I see, that’s um really something”  
Jack felt a little uneasy in her presence it was as if she resented him somehow the vibes he received certainly didn’t feel good.  
“Jack, I will be straight with you. Kara has major plans to offer you out as some mass produced  
expensive toy for all women in this world and I cant let this happen”  
Backing away from Bianca Jack felt very uncertain to where this was going he found some huge perfume style containers on the dresser surface behind him and moved towards them as if they may protect him somehow.  
“Don’t be nervous I’m not going to kill you Jack that isn’t my nature and wouldn’t solve my problems because she would only travel back again in a few years and find some other replacement and it would all start again”  
“You don’t believe in her dream of a little Jack to each lonely woman then?”  
“Not at all, sister lovers world wide are growing in numbers and soon given a decade or so we will become the majority of the population and I know that society will be forced to accept us and our way of life”  
“Being a lesbian I mean sister lover is illegal here?”  
“No, not illegal between consenting women just viewed as an undesirable result of women’s evolution and many see it as unnatural for two women to enjoy each other in a sexual manor so it isn’t encouraged. Kara’s introduction of fashion has fuelled our numbers in recent years with women beginning to show their bodies proudly and those undecided women finally falling to our side of the fence by the new temptations they see. We had dressed so conservatively before all this and the new emphasis on clothes to make us look good is helping my kind to come out and declare them selves.”  
The picture was forming in Jacks mind she didn’t want men to encroach on the growth of her lesbian culture.  
“Then you want me out of the picture, I’m a threat to your way of life”  
“Which is why I’m going to help you escape from here with the rest of those men, I’m going to help you back to your time and fix it so this can’t happen again”  
  
Stunned Jack waited with bated breathe as she revealed her plan. She needed time to re-charge the ships energy cells so Jack could use it. As it had like most things in this time a neural interface she told Jack the basics of how to pilot the vessel and how to find the wormhole using the onboard navigation computer. The other men she informed were still safely onboard and he could revive them simply by unsealing the atmosphere within the boxes they were in.  
“But what about reducing the size of the ship for the wormhole how can I do that without her ring?”  
Jack saw an instant flaw in the plan.  
“The ring is right here, this is where she keeps it when it’s not working”  
Bianca walked over to a side board and reached into a small jewellery box brandishing the ring with the special stone.  
“Not working?”  
“The ring has a peculiar property Jack it can shrink anything all the time but it cannot restore large things or grow large things except for a week or so when has its full powers but it seems to take two years before its ready to go again almost as if it recharges itself.”  
“Wait so Kara last came to my time two years ago to get the first unfortunate guys and then this recent trip two years later but this ring could reduce the ship to pass through the wormhole as it stands.”  
“Yes it could but it can’t grow the ship afterwards or restore a giantess like me or Kara so it’s useless to her until two years time or else she would be a midget in our world for 2 years upon her return something no woman would endure believe me”  
Jack thought back to Kara’s reduced size in the ship it hardly warranted the term midget but he chose to ignore this fact.  
“But you say it can restore small things as it is now”  
”Small things like you, yes and I’m going to give you the ring to help aid your escape, she wont bother to check on it for a long while”  
Bianca offered the huge ring to Jack and he held it in his arms instantly finding that he couldn’t hold its weight as it slammed down at his feet.  
“It’s not quite my ring size”  
He said almost sarcastically.  
“Touch your ring finger to the inner band Jack and open your mind to receive the neural link it’s the same technology in the ring band as what I explained with the ships controls”  
Doing as he was instructed Jack connected with the ring and then could visualise in his head the ring and his finger and suddenly it had shrunk and was on his very finger!  
“Wow!”  
“Now Jack focus yourself on hiding the ring. It has a stealth hologram which Kara uses to conceal it sometimes and you need to hide it from her tonight”  
“Ok Il try”  
He thought about the ring turning invisible and it vanished from view yet he could feel its raised surface when he stoked across the top of his fingers.  
  
Bianca left sometime later having explained that the ship wouldn’t be prepared for flight until after midnight some six hours from the current time, he would have to endure an evening with Kara so as not to rouse her suspicions and then use the ring to help him escape. Bianca would meet him outside Kara’s door at midnight and help him to the ship but for now he found himself trapped in her underwear drawer of all places, knee deep in her giant silk and lace garments just where Kara instructed he should be left to wait for her.  
  
“Well hello little man”  
  
  
##Part 15  
  
The drawer opened and revealed Jack laying upon a pair of sheer tights.  
“Kara”  
“Welcome to the future and your new home, how are you liking it so far little one?”  
”Being locked in the darkness inside this drawer for hours on end isn’t my idea of fun”  
“Awww, is my tiny toy upset with its owner and I thought it would be so comfy for you in there?”  
Kara smiled in a cheeky manor speaking to him like a child.  
“Can I come out now please?”  
His arms raised up waiting for her hand to retrieve him out of the drawer it was so tall that he could never dream to climb out of it.  
“You really want to leave my giant underwear? Oh but then of course you do, its not the same without me inside these things, is it my pet? You’ve missed big Kara haven’t you?”  
Jack didn’t encourage her as she picked him up and then slipped him into the front of a pair of her briefs. As he looked up he could see that she was wearing a bikini a small red one that just about covered her curves and if anything looked far too small for her.  
“time for a gravi-sonic shower”  
Kara stated and walked into a strange room linked to her bedroom much like an en suite except this was an empty room with walls that had tiny little circles upon them glowing gently.   
“You will love this Jack believe me.”  
  
Placing Jack at her feet he watched her wiggle out of her bikini and had the pleasure of casting his eyes on her gigantic three hundred foot plus naked form.  
“I am a lot bigger than last time we played Jack but we don’t have to be so careful anymore not now that Amber has fixed you”  
“Look Kara I…”  
Jack started but was interrupted by the huge bare foot that stepped dangerously close to him.  
“Woah!”  
He jumped to one side scared by her movement.  
“Oh don’t flinch little guy it’s only my pretty little foot”  
“You, nearly stepped on me!”  
“Sorry let me try again”  
The sole of her left foot landed on Jack and pushed him down onto the base of the floor. The weight was incredible yet she was holding back and just wanted to feel him squirming under her sole. He was covered by her foot somewhere under her huge toes. The smell was pleasant but the threat of her body weight coming down upon him like a mountain wasn’t. Kara compressed him even more to the floor and he was forced totally flat and finding himself short of breathe. He recalled how easily she flattened and totalled the car beneath such a foot and he was wondering why she was doing this to him? If it was to scare him then he was scared and if it was to intimidate him he felt very intimidated to under a woman’s foot that could crush him like a bug.  
“Kara!”  
His muffled scream came from under her sole and between her toes. She folded her arms looking down to see nothing but her foot slightly hovering from a perfectly flat position she felt very powerful with Jacks life under her control, if she let herself go and pressed forward she could easily kill him but she didn’t want that. This was going to a lesson for Jack.  
“You had sex with my little sister Jack”  
Kara began.  
“And don’t try to deny it. I saw the glint in Ambers eye she was on cloud nine and all because of you.”  
The foot moved slowly upon him as if she was trying to grind him like you might extinguishing a cigarette yet still the full pressure wasn’t there just a very heavy hint of it as she made her point.  
“You are my man, the original and I’m not willing to share you with anyone do you understand little man? You are mine and only mine”  
Her voice boomed threateningly from above and Jack was in fear of his life.  
“Yes!”  
He cried out  
“Yes!”  
“Good then we have an understanding because I wouldn’t wish to be nasty Jack”  
Her foot retreated and it was as if she changed character from the possessive dominant Kara and then back to her flirty and gentler persona.  
“Sorry if that was uncomfortable little man but you need to know what Kara you mistress allows you to do and what upsets me ok?”  
“Yeh, I got the message”  
Jack said getting to his feet feeling like he had been run over.  
“Time for fun Jack now we have an understanding let me undress you and switch on the gravi-sonic unit”  
She picked him up and hugged him protectively to her breasts as if to apologise and then she removed his clothes putting them with her own at the entrance of the room.   
  
The room was activated by thought and suddenly the small circles surrounding every surface of the walls, ceiling and floor began to pulsate. Instantly Jack found his body in a weightless state and he rose up into the air floating as if suspended by an imaginary force. Kara took longer to begin her elevation but as Jack floated above her blonde head of hair he watched her take flight to join him.  
“You will adore this Jack”  
She said stretching out and floating on her back. It was fun and Jack soon forgot the incident beneath her foot as he soared around like a Superman.   
“Lets play a game little guy, you are a little bird and I’m the giant Hawk”  
Jack was more nimble than Kara who didn’t seem to have his speed or sudden agility. He zipped above her and around her and became very good controlling direction. At one stage he slapped one of his small hand on her rear end which hardly made an impact and Kara spun around to snatch him forcing him to dive through her legs and under her. She then rolled over and Jack was flying beneath her body which reminded him of the opening scene of the original Starwars when the enormous spacecraft flies into the scene getting longer and longer as it over shadows the small craft below.   
He sped up his flight and aimed himself between her breasts managing to sail through this valley before she could close it upon him.  
“Very cute little birdy”  
She admired his speed but Jack was starting to get a little cocky and taking more risks, he landed on the smooth dip in her back at the base of her spine and then ran along her spine leaping off when she attempted to spin around once more to catch him. Now flying down between her legs and following their length Kara tried to work out where he was. Jack attempted a repeat of his breast fly by and zoomed between them laughing to him self but Kara had a trap waiting for him. She had held back her long blonde hair way above and let it fall as he flew under her face and suddenly plunged into a curtain of soft locks that ceased his progress like an aerial net.  
“Gotcha!”  
She laughed and went to grab the small man entangled in her hair. Jack was lucky however and managed to free himself and slipped literally through her fingers and out of her thick blonde hair.  
“Too slow!”  
He quipped and moved off soaring towards the ceiling but Kara this time wasn’t far behind and he saw her mouth open wide looming towards him closer and closer. She seemed to have found a sudden boost to her own speed and he felt the wind of her lips trying to grab at his ankles. It was like a big fish trying to pursue and swallow a smaller one and as Kara climbed at a far more aggressive pace her mouth did close over him entirely!  
Laying in the wet darkness of her mouth as he watched the backs of her teeth closing together like a white brick wall he was sealed in! Although his body was still rather large for her mouth to contain Kara managed to hold him inside for a few seconds but eventually had to released him as his legs where tickling the back of her throat and she didn’t wish to begin reaching or being sick.   
As Jack came out of her mouth her hands were upon him and he was in her grip.  
“Unlucky little birdy! I’ve got you now and its time to visit my nest”  
  
She lay on her back and guided Jack towards her pussy parting the way for him with her free hand and fingers spread across its entrance.   
“In you go!”  
She giggled and pushed him in deep knowing he could survive more easily since his treatment. Again Jack was inside a woman and this time very deep and without the security of a pair of fingers to hold him which was a little unsettling for his safety.   
  
All light was consumed as her entrance closed capturing him in the depths of her love. This was all a little sudden for Jack he hadn’t had any build up or hint of her desire to plunge him into her wetness and he wriggled and fought to turn himself around contorting his body as he found it hard to hold his breathe. The warm wet walls seemed to push upon him as he manoeuvred and his manhood seemed lost in this thick wet interior rubbing and brushing against every part of Kara until it was beginning to feel good to him despite the predicament of being trapped and running out of air.   
He was now able to crawl in the direction of the exit but only because she must have been upside down and floating on her stomach. Gravity aided him to slide and wiggle his way to the flickering shards of light that he could see through his gooey eyes blurred by her juices. By the time his breathe was fading and he was close to breaking free. His manhood had enjoyed the slithering motion along her innards and he deposited his appreciation of this before his head poked between her lips enabling him to gulp a replenishing lung full of fresh air. With just his head and shoulders sticking out of her body and facing the floor below he now felt the wet liquids dripping from her and down the back of his neck. Kara doubled over herself so she could see him and smiled.  
“That was even better than before Jack a multiple orgasm you wonderful toy!”  
She was impressed but Jack was plain tired from his struggles and even though he had found release it wasn’t the usual sense of enjoyment he felt it was as if he had been used by her. He felt the lips of her womanhood slip down his shoulders and he now floated out along with some of her juices that ended up flying around in liquid globules without gravity to let them drip to the floor.   
“Now we clean ourselves”  
Kara announced and in perfect timing to her words a soft light pulsed around their bodies dancing upon every inch of them and making Jacks skin feel like it was crawling with tiny insects for the briefest of moments until it stopped and he felt like a layer of skin had been pealed off. He was the cleanest he had ever felt. Soon after the gravity was reverting to normal and Kara was stood on her feet way before Jack had began to descend. Like a feather falling from the sky he did come down very slowly. He watched below as Kara seemed to line herself up beneath him cupping her breasts together to form a huge ledge with her curves that he gently dropped into and between. Leaving the room she carried him out as he lay down the line of her cleavage.  
  
“You didn’t prepare me for what you did back then Kara! I was totally not ready to be stuffed inside you, down there”  
Jack found himself resenting the way she had treated him it was like he was a toy. But as soon as he had voiced his protest he also wished he had kept his mouth shut.  
“I let you revel in my most private and sensual of areas and you speak to me this way?”  
“I thought you learned some respect under my foot earlier? I really don’t want to harm you Jack but you have to shrug off this whole man thing. You are nothing but a sex toy, my toy and mine to play with how I like and when I like. If I choose to keep you in my pussy here all day then that’s where you will stay. Or if I want a hundred orgasms a day it’s your job to make sure I get them, got it?”  
She pulled her breasts apart and he fell between them and down a long way down! Luckily she knew the bed she was standing over would break his fall but it winded Jack all the same. With a frown she dressed putting on a thin negligee that had silk laces suspended across her ample breasts.   
“Here take this”  
She said reaching onto her dresser and tossing him a large thick brick sized object.  
“It’s sustain 2000 or a little chip of it, I eat that this horrid stuff when I go on long voyages into space. You don’t deserve real food until you start worshipping me like I’m the best thing in your life so this is all you get before bed”  
Jack bit his tongue and looked up nervously at her mighty form looming over him with her fists resting on her hips and he decided to behave himself for fear she might do something else to make him respect her as she put it. Reluctantly he bit into the substance and it tasted as she said pretty awful like a dried biscuit without sugar but it was filling.  
“You won’t need a drink or the bathroom that stuff will fulfil you for a day”  
“I’m sorry. I’m used to making my own choices and commanding my sexual encounters. I will adapt, really I will its just all so knew for me to be with such a powerful woman like yourself”  
Jack conceded and looked up apologetically knowing he had to get on her good side again.  
“You will learn to find your place and talking of which now you have finished that you and I will be going to bed and I had figured that I would make a nice soft bed for you with one of my best bra’s but seeing your attitude tonight I think you deserve to be tied up.”  
This didn’t sound good and Jack wondered what she had in store for him. He watched her look down at her night dress and smirk. Within seconds he was being tied into place with those silk laces in a most uncomfortable manor as he was suddenly strung out like being put on the rack over her boobs which nestled behind him.   
“You might enjoy this for a while being so close to my big boobs but I’m sure it will feel quite different after a night of being held there”  
Jack bounced about as she walked around and he suffered when she brushed her teeth with a laser like device as her great tits wobbled to and fro with her actions. Even thought the silk was soft that bound his arms and legs it was also tight and it began to hurt whilst she was stood upright and he was fixed almost vertical hanging there from his limbs.  
“time for bed sweetie have a nice sleep and dream of me wont you?”  
She shimmied her breasts once more and he grunted a little as it pulled on his arms and legs. Once she laid prone Jack was on his back although the blood was rushing a little to his head at the angle he was positioned. For a long while he rose and fell with each of her mammoth breathes and soon felt her breathing settling into a pattern as she drifted off to sleep. Waiting little more he had to be sure she was asleep before attempting his escape. In his head he called up the ring and interfaced with it easily, he could see a scale aside a mental image of his body which was in percentages of height and he selected the lowest setting effectively shrinking himself to perhaps an inch in size. That inch on a three hundred foot blonde was a bad choice and as his arms and legs slipped from the knots that held them he fell a long way to the base of her cleavage and under the canopy of her thin nightwear.   
  
Jack was a spec upon her body and those breasts were true mountains now creating a valley that would take some time for him to traverse. He hoped she wouldn’t wake and trap him between them because he wouldn’t survive that at his current size. Which way to go he pondered and recalled the orientation of her bed which meant he had to travel south. Keeping himself at this minute size to ensure she wouldn’t feel his footsteps he made his way under her clothes and towards her stomach. The journey seemed long but at least he could see through the flimsy material above with the low level ambient lighting of her room coming through it. Her abdomen was perfect he thought to himself as he walked down the long landscape of her body heading for her navel, and what a navel she had as he circled around it to avoid being trapped inside this deep recess. Typically Kara move at that point in time and he did fall and found himself hanging onto some fine hairs with his feet dangling into her navel area. Thankfully he avoided the drop and continued by pulling himself up. Very soon he was entering her pubic bush he knew it would be easier to circle this and drop down before her sex in order to reach the mattress between her legs, it was certainly less steep than climbing down from her hips.   
Her pubic hairs were a jungle of fair coarse curls and he was a good size to avoid get entangled as he ducked under and stepped over the various shapes they created with their intertwined structures. But he must have begun to make an impression on the sleeping giantess as a hand controlled by her subconscious brushed the area as if to scratch a small itch which was all Jack could be to her now. Jack didn’t realise the hand was upon him until it was too late and he was swept along by it pushed through a field of hairs until he tumbled down and was sliding over her pussy lips. Luckily he didn’t fall for long as her lips had a small residue of stickiness to them that due to his size slowed his decent and then fixed him in place like glue.  
“Oh dam!”  
  
  
##Part 16  
  
He cursed and pushed off from the monstrous sized lips to free himself but in vein he couldn’t overcome the liquids tacky hold on him. Thoughts of Kara waking to find him there crossed his mind and how she would probably push him inside as punishment, at his present stature that would kill him as she would be as deep as an aircraft hanger and he would be lost inside her for real. He decided to risk sizing up a few more percent to increase his strength and did so enabling himself to break free and he instantly fell to the bed sheet below. Kara’s fingers came into his environment under her night clothes to brush at her pussy lips at that moment, again it was a reaction in her sleep but he had to duck those fingers as they just missed him. Avoiding her fingers he had the entire length of her inside leg to run and it certainly gave him a wonderful vista as he was distracted by those great flesh walls either side of him. He preyed she wouldn’t close her thighs and trap him as he ran and felt like he had achieved something to be standing by her heels moments later.  
Peering off the end of the bed the fall was a great height and he sized up once more to aid his decent to the floor using the loose bed sheet to slow him down.   
  
Now he could run the marathon across the floor to the bedroom door in hope that Bianca was the other side. He sized up almost restoring himself to enable more speed as he covered the distance and when he reached the door he took one last look back at the sleeping beauty and then shrunk himself to crawl under the frame of her door.   
  
When his head popped out the other side he was looking at a black barrier that had to be many metres tall. But he soon realised due to the size he had assumed to get under the door he was looking at the tip of a woman’s shoe. Craning his head back he couldn’t see over the toe section which made this the tallest woman he had encountered standing like she was and he hoped it was Bianca.  
Jack sized up moving away from that shoe for safety and soon he was looking under her skirt and able to see that this was Bianca based on the clothes she wore.  
“Bianca! Down here!”  
He shouted hoping his voice was loud enough to get her attention but not loud enough to alert Kara.  
“What kept you?”  
She smiled and reached down for him.  
“Ill put you in my skirt pocket, keep still and quite ok?”  
  
Her voice was loud even in a whisper and he just nodded from her hand. Several minutes later he was taken out after a bumpy ride in her pocket and settled down upon the boarding ramp of the huge spacecraft.  
“You had better shrink this ship, but focus on just the ship and not the box of men in the cargo hold, it’s the only thing in there now and there is plenty of room for it. You will need all your mental energy just to reduce the ship alone, the ring will require a lot more effort to shrink large objects”  
Bianca instructed crouching down to converse with him better.  
“Just point the ring at it and focus to take it down to about a third of its size”  
He did just that and reduced the massive craft but very slowly it almost gave him a headache this time to achieve the result.  
“Remember the ring isn’t working to its full potential now as its powers for shrinking large objects and restoring them are dwindling, you won’t be able to enlarge the ship to full size on your return but then it’s going to dwarf you anyway. I suggest you use its invisibility shielding and set it down somewhere where it cannot be found, you know technology like this could damage the timeline if it’s exploited in your century.”  
”I hadn’t thought that far but yes you’re right I can’t let the authorities get their hands on this”  
“Good, and remember the ring will continue to work for shrinking small objects like yourself and restoring them only, you cant enlarge anything now.”  
“Bianca thank you for doing this, I know there will be a lot of trouble when Kara discovers what you have done”  
“I’m doing this for myself little one, by placing you and that ring back in time through the wormhole no one will be able to travel back and retrieve little men securing the future for women of my persuasion.”  
“Well what ever your motives I’m very thankful”  
“You should hop aboard little one and I would size fully up if I was you”  
“I’m at 100% now this is all me”  
Jack smiled at her.  
“And Jack do you recall everything I told you about operating the neural link to the ship?”  
“I thinks so”  
“Great, then its goodbye”  
He waved at her and walked up the still extremely large boarding ramp and made his way into the ship. Connecting his mind to the craft he ran through the launch procedures which was quite painless instructing the computer to make ready for flight and to plot a course for the centre of the wormhole. The ship powered up and Jack could hear alarms sounding outside as the craft elevated and flew up and out of the small hanger into the night sky.   
  
Walking around the ship he was lost but found the cargo bay and within it the large box that held the other men. Luckily the huge doors around the ship opened automatically even to his small presence via the sensors and he was able to move around freely.   
“Its ok guys we’ll soon be home”  
He said to the box patting its tall side.  
  
After a considerable time the neural link activated on its own and announced that a communication was coming in and did he wish to answer. Intrigued Jack answered to hear Kara’s voice.  
“Jack how could you do this to me? Come back Jack and I will let you live like a king here, please I need you!”  
Her tone was almost begging and he was surprised to hear her so desperate.  
“Kara, I’m sorry but I don’t belong in your time it’s as simple as that, you don’t have the right to take innocent beings from the past and bring them into your future just because we are smaller than you. It all ends tonight”  
”Jack think about what you are giving up, a world of gorgeous women many times your size who all want a piece of you Jack”  
“That’s what I’m afraid of Kara there isn’t enough Jack to go around and I want to stay unique, cloning would diminish my uniqueness you must understand”  
“Then that’s it, you return to you time Jack but remember this I will continue to search for the element that powers that ring you are wearing and I will find some one day and I will come back for you”  
“It’s a chance I’m willing to take”  
”And next time Jack I wont be so subtle Ill tear through your little city at my normal size until I have you in the palm of my hand once more and this time I’m never going to let you go!”  
Her threat rang in his ears but Jack simply offered a casual  
“Goodbye Kara and have a good life”  
He terminated the communication and found out the ship was ready to enter the wormhole at that instant. For a few seconds it seemed as if the world around him blurred and he even thought that he could see multiple images of the ship around him, it was very disorienting but everything seemed to return to normal after this weird occurrence. The journey back to the Earth he knew and loved was fairly swift from that point and Jack only had to bother himself with where he should land this craft. He instructed the craft to conceal itself and decided that the old abandoned quarry at the edge of his home city would be the best choice. The computers navigation was amazing to interface with and provided detailed maps as it scanned the planet upon its approach allowing him to pin-point the quarry. He would worry about a more secure storage site for the craft when he had returned the passengers to safety.  
Walking around the cargo area pleased with himself he began to wonder about the possibilities of using this ship from time to time to explore the galaxy but then recalled it would need recharging which he wouldn’t have a clue how to proceed with. Asking questions to the computer he understood it could recharge itself very slowly in less than a week using some onboard solar cells which was presumably why Kara stayed in his time so long using this method. But even contemplating recharging the craft in this fashion he began to wonder what would happen if Agent Hammond and his colleagues discovered it or worse a terrorist party or unfriendly nation. The risks of it falling under anyone’s control were too great . Bianca was right he shouldn’t tamper with the timeline by letting its technology emerge in his century.   
As the craft began to enter the outer atmosphere layer the computer bleated inside his head with an alert. It was reporting a critical error with the drive systems. His mind quickly questioned for more information as the computer reported the drive system fault was due to an internal shielding failure that could not be repaired it had sustained some damage in the wormhole. The computer suggested pulling into orbit and shutting off the drive to await a recovery vehicle but this would be a solution only open to people in Kara’s time where space travel was frequent and easy. In her time maybe they had a recovery service much like an automobile club but in the year 2005 he could wait for weeks or months for NASA to get a shuttle up to him.   
The computer then predicted the drive would go into overload and explode in less than an hour if he chose this action of assuming orbit. Worse still the ship would explode along with it! His only other alternative was to proceed and enter the atmosphere although the computer predicted that going ahead with this option the drive would overload before he could land as the stress of the system to make it through full re-entry and to reverse thrust was far to great.   
These options meant his death either way so Jack chose to orbit the planet as the computer counted down the time remaining to critical overload. For ten minutes he paced the cargo bay floor feeling like he was so close to home yet so far away at the same time. As he began to contemplate his death all he could think about was Summer, the woman who meant so much to him yet he had never shared his true feelings. If only he had a second chance he thought as he sat down listening to the ship updating on the remaining time. But then in his despair inspiration struck some how he had an idea and questioned the ships computer if there was an escape pod. The computer offered a warning that the onboard point to point emergency transfer unit could be used to allow a single transport to the planet surface however this would deplete the ships entire energy cell rendering it useless, not that this mattered as it was going to destroy itself anyway.   
Jack queried the computer to find out what a point to point system was and discovered from the overview that it was the close to the teleportation devices used in the fictional Star Trek series however this real device was a one way trip due to the enormous energy drain so it wasn’t as useful as the fictional devices made out and used in Kara’s century more like an ejection facility. For Jack it was perfect he could transport down to the quarry away from the main city and the ship would explode in due course leaving no trace or the burden of concealing it. He was saved! Now another challenge presented itself he had the responsibility of the men still secured in the box to consider how could he save them? To use the point to point transfer system he had to be in the main cockpit stood upon a marked section of the floor which was quite a walk from the cargo hold and there was no way to get the giant box there it would be like shifting a small warehouse. The men were doomed he could only save himself and Jack dragged his feet feeling bad about what he was going to do as he approached the teleportation device. He didn’t want to leave the men but self preservation was the only option or was it? His feet stopped as an idea struck him and he hurried back to the box. Focusing the power of the ring he reduced the giant box down to a size he could carry and smiled at his own brilliance. Before abandoned ship he decided to use the computer to find an emergency frequency and transmit a message to Agent Hammond to warn of their immanent arrival, the quarry would be a good place to set down it was far enough out of the city that he could enlarge the men one by one and destroy the packing they came out of before the authorities could get hold of the holographic technology inside those boxes that generated the illusions Kara had shown him.   
This way if Agent Hammond got to the scene it would be too late to see any remnants of future technology that could alter scientific development in his time. Having considered all the possible connotations he noted that time has progressed and he had less than ten minutes an until the ship blew it self up. Instructing the computer to surf random radio frequencies it eventually locked onto what sounded like a military channel spoken in English. Jack was able to talk normally as the neural link replicated his voice through the transmissions he sent and the audio he could hear in response was clear in his mind as it was relayed back directly in the same manor.   
“I have priority message for Agent Hammond I repeat Agent Hammond, this is Jack Steele”  
Jack said and heard the military radio operator inform him to clear this channel as his broadcast was unauthorised and he would be located. Jack smiled to himself and thought if they only knew. He kept up his demands for Agent Hammond and after ten minutes of stalemate the military operator seemed to change attitude. Perhaps they had tracked the origin of his signal and realised it was from space he thought and very soon he was commanding their attention.   
“Unidentified caller you are clear to speak”  
“Agent Hammond?”  
Jack asked.  
“Jack Steele is that really you?”  
“Its me, I’m coming home and I’m bringing all the men with me”  
“Jack this isn’t a secure channel where are you arriving we will send a team to meet with you”  
It was obvious Agent Hammond was trying to keep wraps on things with this open radio channel.  
“Randal Quarry, Ill meet you there over and out”  
Jack signed off and then initiated the point to point unit as he stood over the target area where the unit would focus upon him with the box held tight in his hands. In a sheer instant he was stood in the quarry and didn’t want to think how this device had scrambled his atoms and reassembled him. It was remarkable and so instantaneous.   
  
He looked down at his body and had been so used to wearing no clothes he hadn’t remembered he was still bare and very soon he would stranded in a quarry miles from nowhere butt naked with a bunch of men dressed like dolls waiting for the authorities to find them. He laughed as it would look like a kinky club of transvestites yet he was home and that was all that mattered, soon he thought he would be able to call Summer and apologise for not making their dinner reservation and live happily ever after.   
First of all he needed to attend to business. He opened the box and took out all of the men in the doll cartons one by one laying them down. As fast as he could Jack unpacked them all beginning the revival process as they were removed from the suspended animation imposed on them by the boxes. As some of them began to stir he knew he could not let them see him using the power of the ring to restore them so he placed them down on a ledge below him in the quarry and climbed up above them with the remnants of the tiny boxes now in his possession. Using the ring he restored them all one by one to their original heights and just in the nick of time as the first ones to be freed began to regain consciousness wondering where he was. Jack quickly shrunk the box remains even further so they were almost imperceptible and covered them in the chalk beneath his feet, then he felt nervous about his nakedness hearing the guys below talking and he scoured the area for something to cover his manhood. He found an old refuse sack and sat himself down on a large rock with it stretched over his lap and waited.   
  
A plain helicopter buzzed across the sky and was summarily waved down by the men who stood on the large ledge jumping up and down. Jack laughed wondering what the pilot would make of all those grown men in girly dresses flagging him down and the half naked guy sitting several metres higher up watching it all happen. Another helicopter similarly non descript converged with the first and what looked like a decontamination team rushed out to everyone. Jack suddenly realised they still had the misconception that Kara was an alien and perhaps expected they all may need quarantining and screening in case of some extra terrestrial bugs. He was then shocked as the men took out what looked like guns!  
“Wait a minute!”  
Jack shouted but one by one the guns fired at the men including Jack and they all fell to the ground, the last image he had was looking at his shoulder where a small dart had penetrated his skin and he knew he had been tranquilised but why?  
  
Waking up he felt hung over and was expecting to be in a hospital bed but it was room a dark room and he was clothed in a pair of simple overalls. He climbed out of what looked like to a prison cell bed and walked to the door which was locked. Instantly he slammed his hands ranting and raving to be heard at the top of his voice.  
“Jack please be seated”  
It was Agent Hammonds voice.  
“Hammond get me out of here now!”  
“Calm yourself Jack we just need a little debriefing that’s all, we have cleared you and the others of any potential contaminants and this is just an interrogation unit at one of our safe houses before we let you go. Now Jack all those men you saved seemed to have some interesting tales but nothing that extend beyond being shrunken and packed away like a doll. However you seem to be the hero Jack when you contacted me the N.I.A.T.A had already been tracking transmission signal and assumed it was from an orbiting vessel?. Were you in command of a ship, a spacecraft Jack? Did you destroy it, because we registered a huge explosion not long after our last communications?”  
“It was going to blow up Hammond I just rescued the men and myself using some transporter device in the ship but listen it wasn’t alien technology….”  
Jack told the story editing parts he felt they didn’t need to hear but leading to Bianca and his escape and making sure to omit the existence of the ring in his possession informing Bianca has used it to reduce the ship and he had teleported all the men in an unconscious group. It seemed that Agent Hammond bought his story but didn’t like the result of it.  
“So we encounter beings from the future with technological advances I cannot begin to fathom and you bring back nothing?”  
Agent Hammond sounded off clearly annoyed but Jack was equally annoyed.  
“Hell I saved those men what more do you want? Just let me go and get on with my life will you I’ve had enough of all this bullshit!”  
“Sorry Jack but the men you rescued can go back to their lives we have ensured they will not talk but you have been compromised Jack you can’t go back to your former life”  
“Compromised!”  
“Sorry Jack but its impossible to reintegrate you to your old life and you know too much, far too much”  
The intercom went dead and Jack had visions they were going to erase his identity like they had with this hypnosis they had performed on Tony Markham’s partner. As these scary thoughts ran through his head he watched a yellow gas enter the room from a vent on the ceiling……  
  
Jack or Bruce as he was now known was walking through the forest and taking note of the bird boxes that needed replacement. His job as a forest ranger required a lot of time on his own in the remote regions of Derwent Forest and he was living quite happily in a small ranger out post in the centre of small clearing and next to an idyllic looking lake. Every day was the same he would get up and leave his small wooden shack and check on the animals and wildlife that he was responsible for calling in the updates over the radio every evening. He felt for sometime like something was missing in his life but couldn’t put a finger on it. Being isolated in this forest he had a lot of time on his hands to think and very recently he started to get small memory flashbacks and hallucinations occurring. The first of these flash backs was triggered by the discovery of some poachers traps he had uncovered in the forest as he called in the incident on the radio that evening.  
“Henry I figure the Poachers are rotating in a pattern covering the south of the forest but they are not only setting traps. I actually found a slug in the base of a redwood, I’m certain its calibre if you check with a ballistics expert will match a high velocity round from a Hawk rifle. The Hawk is unique only a few of them in circulation under special permits….”  
“Man you sound like a cop how the hell do you know all that Bruce?”  
“I err just do….Henry I’ll call later”  
That first night Bruce seemed to recall working for the police in some capacity it was like drawing broken memories from a previous life but every now and then things were very vivid he knew things about weapons and criminal matters yet he couldn’t place things entirely like where he had been connected to the Police force and in what capacity.   
He had always felt over these last few weeks a little strange his memory was pretty scrambled about most things and his earliest memory was his recovery in hospital. The doctor said he had fallen from a tree in the forest and was found by some hikers and the result of his fall was long term amnesia which they didn’t predict would rectify itself. He was a loner according to the Doctor an isolationist who sought the comfort of jobs like his current ranger position that took him away from the general populous. Having left hospital he went straight back to work at least he could recall very easily his current life style as a ranger yet the glimpses of the past felt so real connecting him to another life a job maybe in the city and definitely with the police force. There was no one he could talk to about this no one close in his life.  
The next day Bruce was in the forest as normal and at the base of the mighty redwood he had found the bullet inside. When he looked up at this tree his mind suddenly flashed back to the view of a woman’s shapely leg as tall as the very tree before him. It was such a vivid memory and it felt so real yet so completely odd.  
Before long Bruce began to piece together fragments of his previous life including his real name and where he lived and most importantly he woke one morning remembering Summer! The woman he loved! He began to shrug his forest duties and focused on recalling the past, his life as Jack and the memories of his amazing journey to the future came flooding back bit by bit as he tried to piece it all together , reconstructing who he was and trying to work out how he had ended up like this.   
“Henry”  
Jack called on the radio with an urgency in his voice.   
“Can you patch me through to an external line?”  
His pal Henry the only human he had conversed with for the past month a man he considered his friend put him through to the police department that he used to work for and he asked for Summer to be told she had switched departments. Of course he now remembered the conversation that night on their balcony she had taken the new job. His call was forwarded to speak with Summer and he was elated when he heard her voice answering his call.  
“Detective Inspector Summer Wales can I help?”  
”Summer it’s me Jack, Jack Steele”  
“Who is this! How dare you!”  
Summer barked a vicious reaction he didn’t anticipate.  
“Summer it’s me Jack”  
He repeated to receive an equally icy and angry reply.  
“Jack Steele died over a month ago what sort of sick pervert are you? I can trace this call you know?”  
“Summer I’m alive its me listen to my voice, they told you lies I’m not dead!”  
It took some convincing over the phone and he had to answer a question from her to satisfy it was truly him.  
“Ok if you are Jack then what did you say the last night we were together alone in your apartment you said I looked different and only Jack Steele would know the answer to this?”  
“I said you looked short but I should have said you are beautiful Summer”  
There was a delay in response and Summer began to sob madly.  
“Oh Jack how? I thought…” She sniffed in mid tear “I thought I had lost you. They told me you were dead killed by the kidnapper after you saved those men, they said that insane woman blew you and herself up… I even attended your funeral service”  
“They lied to you Summer the authorities wanted to cover up what happened the crazy things that happened to me. They did something to my mind to try and erase my past but its coming back to me now and the memory of you is making everything so much clearer. I want my life back and I want you to be part of it Summer”  
“Oh Jack”  
“Listen I can’t talk now but meet me, tonight at Rigolota’s”  
“8pm”  
  
  
##Part 17  
  
“Yes only this time I won’t let you down trust me”  
Jack felt wonderful to hear her voice as they ceased their conversation. Calling up Henry once more on the radio he asked to be airlifted in the Ranger helicopter which was only really used for search and rescue mission outside of dropping supplies to him once every two weeks.  
“Henry don’t ask questions please just do this for me, fly me to the city tonight and I will forever be in your debt my friend”  
”Bruce this is highly irregular against all procedures and flight plans but if its that important to you Bruce Ill do it but you really do owe me one big time”  
  
That evening Jack found his smartest clothes from the small selection in his wardrobe, a shirt and a pair of formal trouser with some slip on shoes. They weren’t his taste but he only realised that now as his memories kept flowing through bringing him closer to normal with every passing hour.   
He cursed the agency for trying to cover his past and for sticking him in this location miles from anyone and anywhere. To spite them he was determined to meet Summer and he would sort out restoring his identity as soon as it was possible making things all public if he needed. But his top priority was to make up for lost time with the only girl he had really loved a girl he had a second chance with which he wasn’t going to blow.  
  
The ranger helicopter hovered overhead and Jack ran out to the pilot climbing into the back of the craft and buckling into the seat. He stuck on his head gear and radio microphone to speak with Henry, thanking him for helping with his unusual request and he watched the sprawling forest roll past out of the window. The journey was an hour to the city and he was dropped off at a small city airport five miles from the restaurant. A short cab ride later and he was seated in the restaurant a little early but eager to meet with Summer. He had selected a private dining area in a booth to the far side of the restaurant and sat staring at his watch counting down the minutes to her arrival. As he was lost in his thoughts there was a distinctive smell of perfume and a pair of arms wrapped around his neck from the side as he sat there surprised by her arrival. He hadn’t heard her due to his day dreaming but Summer instantly kissed him and then slid herself into the chair opposite with a smile that just lit up the room she was so pleased to see him. It was a smile that Jack reflected back this all felt so right to him.   
Looking across at his dinner partner she looked ravishing dressed in a short black skirt and a figure hugging red blouse, her long dark hair was styled up with a few trailing curls dropping to the sides of her face and a long ponytail swishing behind her. They locked eyes over the table and Jack was drunk in the moment as he let her big green eyes draw him in.  
“Where do I start Summer? It’s so good to see you. I’ve been such a fool. I should have told you the things my heart wanted to say years ago, I care for you Summer so much. You were the one I thought of in my hour of need and I’ve wasted so much time in not revealing my true feelings.  
I love you Summer”  
His words took her breathe away it was what she had wanted to hear for so long and all she could do was to smile back and softly agree from her heart.  
”Jack Steele I’ve always loved you”  
They had a wonderful meal but didn’t really notice the food as the conversation flowed between them so intensely. Jack filled Summer in on some of his crazy sounding adventures minus some finer details he spared her from and she believed him despite how fantastic it all sounded. She knew it was the truth and it explained clearly all damage to her property and the mysterious incidents across the city which all ended the day Jack disappeared, everything made sense.   
  
“So Mister Forest Ranger I guess you have nowhere to stay tonight, how about you come home with me?”  
She invited playing with her hair anxious to be alone with Jack as they waited to settle the bill.   
“How could I resist Summer you look gorgeous, no absolutely stunning tonight”  
Jack smiled at her drinking in her beauty.  
“Thank you. You know I really made an effort that evening we were supposed to meet here. I took on board your reactions to that tall blonde that night it made so jealous and the fact you labelled me as short that day at your apartment didn’t help. So I decided to go all out for you Jack and I bought these”  
Summers right leg emerged from under the table showing off some serious high heeled court shoes that matched her skirt. Jack took note of them and smiled they were very sexy finishing off her shapely smooth pins to perfection.  
“I thought another seven inches might help bridge the gap between us a little. These are the highest pair on the high street, I’ve never worn such a big pair but I’m really starting to like them”  
There was a laugh from Jack.  
“Summer I haven’t got a problem with your height you are perfect the way you are. I’m used to looking down on women at six foot five I haven’t much choice. That Kara I told you about just took me by surprise that night that’s all. I don’t mind you being short believe me”  
“But you admitted you like her being taller than you, didn’t you Jack?”  
“Ok yes I enjoyed it, I liked it. But it’s not like any normal woman’s ever going to measure up to me like that again, so you don’t need those heels unless you really want to wear them around me?”  
“Question is Jack do you like me in them?”  
“Of course”  
He didn’t hesitate in response. The waiter interrupted them at that moment and Jack handed over some cash to pay for the bill. As he walked off Summer commented.  
“Glad you said that because they cost me the earth and I rather like the new elevated Summer, its nice strutting around as a six footer. You know when I came here tonight I was even looking down on that waiter its kind of nice not to be looking up at everyone all the time.”  
“Even at six foot you will still need your tip toes to kiss me Summer”  
“Is that an offer Jack?”  
“Of course?”  
Jack stood up and presented the crook of his arm out for her to grab hold of it and smiling Summer balanced on her new heels and stood up to join him.   
  
It was at that moment for both of them that time seemed to stall into slow motion. Jack felt at first her more noticeable weight pulling on his arm and was surprised by this but as she stood up his surprised turned to disbelief when petite little Summer was rising above him! She stood up straight and let go of his arm to adjust her short skirt upon her thighs before she looked forward towards Jack. Jack however was looking forward and then up at her, way up at her! Summer had a considerable height advantage over him. She was oblivious to this difference at first because she looked forward and lost sight of Jack. Her view was clean over him! She initially figured he had disappeared somewhere and had a confused expression upon her face.  
“Jack?”  
She questioned looking to see where he had walked off and she stepped forward only to bump into something below, which turned out to be someone. Jack meantime was gob smacked by this occurrence at first he couldn’t get over how she could be so extremely tall and then he was distracted by the realisation that looking straight ahead at Summer his eyes were only just level to her very ample chest. A chest that was suddenly moving towards him until her blouse and that firm womanly figure behind it bumped into his forehead.   
“Down here”  
He said stepping back still confused by what had just occurred. Looking up to find her eyes he saw the bemused expression that fell on this tall dark haired beauty as she tried to comprehend the situation. She had just bumped into a very short man who happened to be Jack.  
“Jack, look at you down there”  
“Summer you’re so tall? What’s going on here? Those heels must be enormous your wearing?”  
In hope he looked down what now seemed some very long legs to the shiny black leather high heels below but the heels were only seven inches and didn’t explain why she stood more than a full head and shoulders over him at that very moment in time.  
“What on earth? I’m towering over you Jack? This cant be real, stand up properly, please”  
She smiled to think it was just a joke for her benefit after his stories about giant women and shrinking but his face told the true story.  
“I am standing up. But why am I looking up at you?”  
“Jack you don’t even reach up to my shoulders, what’s going on?”  
Jack sat back down for a moment as if trying to see if the situation would alter somehow when he stood back up. Summer then took his hand.  
“Jack stand up here with me again, please”  
She encouraged and he could her bare feet as she had slipped out of her shoes wanting to eliminate this advantage. But as Jack took to his feet still wearing his own formal shoes, Summer was still a lot taller than him as he looked forward at her slender neck feeling conscious of her heaving bosom that was now threatening to consume his chin from below.  
“I’m still taller than you. Much taller? Jack what happened?”  
Summer looked concerned and Jack was still amazed by this all.  
“I’m not sure”  
He remarked lost for an answer and then added.  
“Tell me that you’ve grown whilst I was away and have become seven foot tall Summer. Tell me that it’s not me who has suddenly become a shrimp”  
A pair of hands settled on his shoulders in a comforting manor.  
“I’m five foot five inches tall Jack, I’ve been five foot five since I was sixteen years old and you must be…?”  
“Not even close”  
Jack jumped in not wishing to hear his size confirmed.   
  
They decided to leave the restaurant and walked outside. Summer purposely left her shoes off carrying them in her hand as if it would make Jack feel better about the situation but secretly she was itching to put them back on. She actually liked looking down on Jack after the initial shock of it all. To her it somehow felt nice to be taller than him. Jack felt self conscious seeing her dilemma she was trying to spare his embarrassment by refraining from slipping her heels back on but he had to address this.  
“Summer put your heels back on you could step on glass or anything”  
“But I didn’t want to intimidate you Jack”  
She stopped in her tracks before him on the pavement they were alone and he smiled up at her.  
“Summer I don’t mind if you don’t? Sometimes a little intimidation can be very nice”  
Encourage she slipped her shoes back on once more assuming a towering stance over him. Before they continued to walk Summer hugged Jack to her body purposely pressing his face lovingly into her ample bust which now lined up perfectly. Peering up at her face above he was surprised by her action as Summer grinned down at the once large man now short enough to be cuddled to her breast.  
“Sorry but I couldn’t resist shorty. Is the type of nice intimidation you were talking about?”  
She giggled and Jack laughed stepping back pulling his face out of her blouse and continuing their walk to her car. Strolling side by side with Summer this way was such a new experience for Jack noticing the top of her skirt and those curvy hips it outlined wiggling very close to his shoulder line and the profile of her breasts jiggling catching the corner of his eye with each on of her steps.   
“You walk too fast”  
Jack commented to Summer noting he was having to make relatively swift progress beside her.  
“My legs are longer than yours”  
She grinned in a flirtatious manor and then winked down at him. Jack knew she was enjoying this but despite his own curiosity of seeing a much taller Summer he wanted to figure things out when they reached her house.   
  
Summer lived literally around the corner. Their walk wasn’t long and before it was over Jack did attempt to reach his arm up around her waist which felt natural as a gesture but impractical as his arm reached uncomfortably high. Seeing his misjudgement she moved closer to him offering.  
“I don’t mind if it’s easier for you to hold me lower down Jack”  
Her words were playful and he slid his hand downwards resting it around her firm rear and feeling it shift beneath her skirt whilst her arm slid easily over his shoulder line ending in a large feminine hand and fingers on his shoulder top.   
  
She seemed such a different woman than before and he hadn’t felt these feelings since that first encounter with Kara in the bar only Summer didn’t need the pheromone attractant. As they walked up the path to her front door Jack noticed the new construction that was almost finished rectifying the damage upon the property that the Kara had caused. They walked into the house and Jack was told to make himself at home, he promptly settled on the sofa looking around at her room as Summer fixed them both a drink from the open plan kitchen nearby.   
“So have you figured it out yet Jack? Why you are so short? Is it what that Kara woman has done to you? Will you um stay like this?”  
Jack hadn’t even thought that far and wasn’t about to just yet, he recalled the ring in his search for an answer and felt his finger to find it was still present.  
“I might have a solution! I think I know what’s happened here, you remember in my story I said that Kara reduced me during the journey to her time so I would fit into the box under the guise of being a toy doll. Well she made a point of shrinking me beyond the level of other men to fit in with her deception as she wanted me to be a smaller version of the doll compared to the others. I know back then she reduced me to four foot ten inches tall for that purpose only I don’t think she ever grew me back whilst I was in the future.”   
“You look about the size of my friends little girl and I know she’s less than five feet, four ten is probably right”  
“Then that does explain my current height or lack of and it also explains why Agent Hammond said that the others could go back to their lives they hadn’t been physically altered but he said I had been compromised. That’s because he knew I was reduced. It’s the same thing they did to Tony Markhams partner to push all the evidence under the carpet and erase an innocent victim’s life to suit them. With my head all screwed up and being isolated in that forest I hadn’t realised until now.”  
“They are despicable”  
Summer said walking back to join him offering a cold beer.  
“So Jack what’s the solution?”  
“The ring I told you about Summer I’m still wearing it they obviously didn’t detect its presence as its still shielded from view!”  
Jack concentrated to make the ring visible and it emerged as if by magic impressing Summer.  
“And you control it with your mind?”  
“Yeh it’s easy just a focused thought. But if I concentrate I should be able to use it on myself and restore my inches. In a few seconds I will be looking down upon my short girlfriend even in those heels you are wearing”  
“And there was me starting to like being the tall girlfriend”  
“Not for much longer”  
He spoke confidently and then stood up and shut his eyes instructing the ring to restore his height.   
“Did it work?”   
Jack looked about feeling little different.  
“There’s one way to find out”  
Summer said standing up and once more putting Jack in the shade.  
“It didn’t work Jack. I’m still up here and you are still way down there, look your about level with my boobs if you haven’t noticed”  
A small grin crossed her lips as she made that cheeky point drawing a line from his head to her chest.  
“There practically in my face I would have job not to. However it’s not the worst height to be against a beautiful woman like you”  
”I can think of how handy it might be Jack”  
Her voice melted in a sexy tone but Jack resisted for now to continue this line of banter and focused on his height.  
“Ok so it won’t let me restore myself but maybe.”  
He paused and took the pint glass Summer had just handed him pointing the ring at it. The glass reduced to half its height in seconds amazing Summer.  
“Wow”  
“Lets see if I can restore it”  
Jack focused and the glass returned to normal.   
“Ok, that works so what if I shrink it by a third”  
The glass reduced once more.  
“and then I hand you the ring. Don’t worry it’ll adjust to your size”  
Summer slipped the ring on and suddenly had the mental images of its control in her head.  
“this is so cool, so now you want me to restore the glass?”  
“Exactly, just as Kara shrunk me a little but now a different wearer is instructing the ring to restore the shrunken object”  
“It’s not working”  
A frown appeared across her face.  
“But I can still shrink it and restore it?”  
The glass reduced further and restored back to its two thirds starting point yet not beyond.  
“Oh dear”  
“What does it mean Jack?”  
“The ring obviously resets itself when it changes wearers anything a person shrinks only they themselves can restore to the full height they first encounter it as and if another person addresses an object already reduced it interprets that objects normal height value to be its starting point or its full height.”  
”But what does this mean for you?”  
Summer leaned forward arching a little resting her hands on her knees to look at him face to face making him feel shorter even if she wasn’t trying to.  
“It means Summer that for the next two years I’m going to be looking up at a very big girlfriend”  
“You mean your going to be four foot something until this thing allows you the function to enlarge objects again. And the enlargement function is locked into this bi-annual cycle you mentioned”  
“ Yep, this is as tall as I can get or as short as I’m gonna be compared to you for a long time”  
  
Standing up tall once more Summer couldn’t help but find this fact appealing.  
“I actually kind of like you this way”  
Her voice was soft and sincere.  
“Even though I’m half the man I used to be? I won’t be able to hold you in my arms like I could have done Summer and you will be have to get used to being out and about with a guy who doesn’t measure up to your suddenly very statuesque size”  
“Statuesque I like the sound of that. It sure beats being referred to as short by you although you won’t be in a position to call me shorty whilst you’re stuck down there.”  
“Guess the tables have turned and I’m going to be called shorty from now on”  
Jack resided himself to this fact it was going to be a long two years. Perhaps some of the time ahead would be enjoyable he thought looking on the positive side with his new perspective of Summer.  
  
“You know I’ve got a natural seven inches on you without these new high heels of mine! I think having a short stop for a boyfriend is going to be very refreshing it’s kind of like we have swapped heights and now I’m the taller one. And Jack as for you holding me in your arms I can’t wait for that but in the meantime I can give you some wonderful hugs whilst you are this short that I know you you’ll enjoy”  
Once more she crushed him lovingly to her breasts and his face was again full of her blouse with a literal eye full of cleavage. Being hugged this way turned Jack on and his hardness was forming in his trouser leg and brushing against her lower thigh something Summer noted straight away.  
“I knew you liked my big hugs .You definitely have a thing for taller women don’t you Jack?”  
Stepping back Summer was equally aroused and he could make out the impressions of her nipples now defining themselves beneath her blouse.   
“Kiss me Jack”  
Her challenge came and he naturally leaned up on the extent of his tip toes to meet her lips as Summer watched the spectacle of this once towering man who was now struggling to get close to her lips.  
“You know you’re closer to kissing my breasts than my face”  
She giggled and then bent her knees allowing herself to meet his lips and they locked in a passion that was very intense. As the kiss broke the electricity between them was confirmed.  
“Let me make this a little easier for you half pint”  
With her shoes slipped off they could meet each other half way with a little effort from both sides. Jacks hands roamed her rear as they continued to kiss which was still higher up than he expected and Summer reciprocated by pulling his shirt out of his trousers and searching her hand up inside as the other hand released the buttons from the outside.   
“I’ve wanted this for so long Jack”  
“Summer we should have done this a long time ago”  
  
Kneeling down Summer removed his trousers and then his boxer shorts to see his member pointing upwards begging for attention. To Jack those hands were large and felt like they spanned a lot of the inches between his legs as she stroked his excitement raising him to another level.   
“You know this is probably a lot more manageable than it would have been at your normal height”  
“manageable?”  
For Jack that sounded like small as he watched her play with him.  
“For starters I don’t think I would have been able to bury it so easily in between these before”  
With a very sexy move Jack looked down and saw her pull the end of her blouse out from her skirt and then release the lower buttons, from this angle he could see down into her blouse and the dark cleavage line that was clearly prominent. Her next action briefly took his breath away as she moved up on her knees and guided his manhood under that blouse and up into the warm captivity of her cleavage until he could feel his helmet and shaft completely surrounded.   
Lustfully letting his eyes study the neck of the blouse he could see that his length was buried in her softness. He wasn’t large enough to break the surface of that cleavage and it emphasised just how busty Summer was to take him so completely in this manor. She bobbed up and down until he could just see his sensitive peak breaking free of her curves coming up for air between those warm all encompassing breasts that sandwiched it. Jack soon began to feel weak at the knees as she heightened his arousal. Summer noticed he was well on the path to release and stood up letting his shaft pull free from her breasts. In a very slow action, purposely slowly she rose to her feet letting the tip of her mounds rub delightfully up his torso. Continuing her ascent she didn’t pull back forcing his chin to slide into her cleavage raising his face to her eyes as his head tilted back and then sliding that chin down until he was staring at the outside of her blouse once more face to face with her bosom as she assumed her full height sliding back into those large heels. Jack grasped her skirt his fingers chasing for the fastening point but Summer took his hands away not in a manor to deter him but she wanted them elsewhere right now. He felt her larger palms just proud of his own as she manoeuvred his hands to her front and then under her blouse in search of the treasures that pushed it out so well. Guiding his hands up he felt the soft exterior of her bra and his hands gladly took the hint that his attentions would be well received where they now settled. Summer had to be at least a D cup he thought but her size was distorted now by trying to gauge each of these large curves in his smaller hands. He couldn’t hope to contain them they seemed so much bigger than he had every imagined forcing his eyes to focus on her blouse as if to ensure it was all Summer under there.  
“Here let me help”  
She said softly and opened up her blouse which visually grew her cleavage line a considerable degree. Jacks eye line was right in the middle of her bra as his hands busied themselves circling those curves in fluid motions.  
“I bet these are bigger than you expected eh Jack?”  
Could she read his mind?   
“Much bigger”  
These true words tumbled from his mouth before he meant them to.  
“A sexy benefit of being a lot smaller than your big girlfriend”  
She smiled kissing the top of his head and enjoying his touch.   
“And here is another benefit, you are just tall enough to reach them now”  
Snapping her bra catch her breasts sprung forward at him pointing thick dark nipples at his face which Jack soon embraced with an open mouth to suck and kiss her bare flesh. Summer gasped and moaned as he skilfully attacked her mounds with his oral assault.  
“just the right size….oooh…..that is sooo good Jack!”  
She enthused from above and pulled the back of his head into her as if begging for him to take more of her breast, yet it did little but plaster him into their giving forms.   
  
Summer eventually broke off this contact before it drove her over the edge she wanted to prolong their foreplay.  
“Jack there are other places you can kiss me, places where a girl gets even more excited”  
“Why don’t you lay down and Ill see if I can find those places”  
Jack grinned at her invitation but Summer had no intention of laying down just yet.  
“Wouldn’t it be sexier if I was still standing and so were you?”  
“Still standing? Summer you’re not that tall compared to me”  
“But I could be Jack with the help of this little gadget”  
Standing in a provocative pose Summer focused upon Jack and began to reduce his height with the ring that she was still wearing. He suddenly began to feel himself shrink watching her body rise over him, her large breast seemingly expanding until he was no longer looking straight at them but up to them. Her belly button seemed to wink as him as it too was now rising above his head and the waist band of her skirt began to fill the view of his girlfriend.  
“Wow, look at you. You are getting so short compared to me. Really short, your head is barely level with the top of my skirt now, how does it feel to be down there?”  
“I feel dam short and you look like an amazon”  
“An amazon? Now I like that description! But I need to be more than an amazon because you need to be shorter than these long legs of mine for what I have in mind”  
Again he began to shrink at her will watching the flat plain of her black skirt rise above his head. Now he was looking dead centre into that material fully aware that her legs behind that mini skirt now held several inches above him. The view below also hit home the inches he had just lost as her large shoes dwarfed his own but this was far less impressive than the realisation that her knees were very close to his chest level now.  
“ Now my sexy long legs can surround you and I can easily do this”  
She stepped forward raising the edge of her skirt hitching its figure hugging material over his head and then allowing his head to be contained under that very material bringing him face to face with her the silky thong she was wearing beneath. Jack was quite surprised how Summer had assumed this dominating role so readily but he was enjoying her actions. Taking the extreme hint of what she wanted his fingers instantly reached up under the canopy of her skirt and pulled aside that thong for his tongue to go to work. His actions were right on target and Summer was now on the edge.   
“Oh Jack finish me! I’m yours”  
She cradled his head through the outside of her skirt pressing his face deeper to her sex as she climaxed and held him there for those few seconds of an absolute high.  
Letting Jacks head out from the cover of her short skirt she kneeled down to find herself still a touch taller than him. Her larger lips began a long deep kiss, a commanding kiss because of her size and how her large tongue beat his own into submission. It was strange for Jack to receive a tongue which filled his smaller mouth whilst simultaneously sensing her lips overpowering his and stretching wider and fuller across his face.  
  
  
##Part 18  
  
“Oh Jack, take me, make love to me as an amazon”  
She laid across the carpeted floor swiftly removing her underwear and skirt, her large breasts leaning to the sides slightly yet still pointing up from her chest to defy gravity.  
  
Jack positioned himself between her legs wondering if he could please such a large woman as Summer was to him now but not hesitating to find out. He plunged his length into her wetness and drove all of it home with none to spare, at his normal size he may well have overwhelmed her petite proportions but now he was on the small side and easily accommodated by Summers sex. It felt good to Jack and Summer seemed to be satisfied by the connection he had made as he moved himself rhythmically inside her. Another cry from Summer announced a second score and Jack followed soon after.  
  
As they stood up Summer was grinning like the Cheshire cat, teasingly she tousled his hair from above.   
“For a little guy you certainly know how to give a big woman a good time”  
“You know I’d like to repeat that when I regain my full size, just to show you what a big guy I can be”  
“Well that’ll be something to look forward to in two years time but for now you’re my pint sized lover and I rather like you this way”  
They cleaned up in her bathroom and as Jack watched her covering that lovely figure back up with her clothes he spotted his trousers and boxer shorts which hadn’t shrunk with him.  
“Can you zap me bigger Summer I don’t think my trousers will fit me now”  
“I could”  
She hesitated with casting a cheeky look.  
“Or I could reduce them to your current size. Fancy staying like that for a while?”  
“What this short?”  
“It’ll be kind of fun to have you like this for the rest of the evening”  
“Well I guess if you like it why not, as long as you don’t mind me eyeing up your long legs”  
“I insist on it shorty”  
With his clothes reduce to fit Jack and Summer enjoyed spending time together as they cuddled up on her sofa laying across it together to face the television.   
  
For Jack everything was a new experience as Summer logically positioned her body behind his slimmer frame in order to lay comfortably with him and where his feet stopped her legs kept on going to the end of that sofa offering a good visual reminder of how much shorter he presently was.  
“I guess our little session back there answered my fears of whether you could handle a short boyfriend for a couple of years”  
“Jack I’d say I handled you pretty well”  
They laughed and enjoyed chatting further about Jack’s adventures and how fascinating he found it to be in the future. He also began to labour upon how big the giantess were in that time and the conversation then seemed to spark immense curiosity from Summer.  
“What I want to know is how did it feel to be so tiny compared to those women Jack? Like that Kara she sounds so enormous when you describe her did it frighten you?”  
“It was a little scary when I was down by her feet I mean she could crush cars with those things”  
“Apart from the scary aspect was any of it enjoyable? I mean what did she look like from your perspective”  
“She was a giantess Summer, I can only describe the experience like being in the presence of a skyscraper. Something so massive you don’t expect for it to be moving but when it does you are just so blown away by its size.”  
“But did you enjoy it? I mean her being that big and holding you in her hand or placing you in her pockets?”  
“Well, it gives a guy a new definition of big…”  
He began and Summer soon latched on to his words  
“Big, of course I mean a woman that incredible size would be so much more substantial to you like her boobs for example”  
“Yeh you kind of can’t help noticing breasts when they are as large as a medium sized house”  
“mmm, it does make you wonder doesn’t it?”  
“You’d like to try being smaller Summer? I could fix that if you give me the ring we could shrink you down here so I would become a giant if that’s what you’d like to try?”  
Summer sat up and Jack was practically sat on her lap now like a small child and shifted himself to the seat beside his tall girlfriend.  
“No, I would be far to scared it certainly doesn’t appeal to me to be small, I’m short as it is for a woman. I would hate to be any shorter and being tiny well I wouldn’t want to go there”  
“Sorry I thought you were intrigued by it”  
“I am very, but I was kind of hinting that it would be nice to see you a little smaller and for me to feel like a giantess”  
Jack looked at the sincerity in her eyes this really did interest her.  
“Summer I’m already like a midget to you now. You look like a great big amazon already”  
“And this is pretty cool Jack but it would be amazing to hold you in the palm of my hand here to put my boyfriend in my blouse pocket or somewhere else”  
She almost blushed  
“Would you do it for me Jack? Let me shrink down to a teeny tiny size just for a little while?”  
He had to admit it would be interesting to be around Summer like that, if he had learned anything from his time with Kara and Amber women only grew more beautiful with size and the experiences that much more intense and being like this with his new beautiful girlfriend could be far more appealing.  
“Wait a minute Summer a teeny tiny size, what did you have in mind?”  
“I don’t know sort of pocket sized and so I can hold you easily in my hand here, small really small to me. Maybe three inches like this, no an inch tall that would be really something to see”  
“How about we do this in stages kind of acclimatize me”  
“Perfect then you’ll let me?”  
“Go ahead”  
“Time to shrink my little boyfriend, time to watch Summer grow”  
She announced dramatically and focused on reducing him and very soon he was aware of the sofa rising above him and her body keeping scale to it as he was a little more than a foot tall in seconds.  
“There you are just over fifteen inches tall, look how tiny you are”  
Jack walked over to her skirted thigh and climbed up onto the taught platform of material stressed across her lap.   
“That’s a mighty long pair of legs you have down there lady”  
He remarked and Summer extended a long limb just to show him exactly how long it was.  
“How about you slide down there Id like to get an impression of just how much bigger I am than you”  
“Sure, but I hope your legs are smooth”  
“The cheek! If there not I’m gonna make you shave them by hand and keep you this small whilst you do it, that should keep you busy”  
“Sounds fun”  
He laughed and moved cautiously out onto her thigh and beyond the end of her skirt straddling as best he could the thick expanse of leg beneath him. Edging himself to her knee he was aware of the fall it was a good twenty or more feet up. His eyes traced the line of the rest of that leg descending gracefully down into her high heels a sight that was very welcoming.  
“You have gorgeous legs lady”  
He praised  
“Why thank you tiny sir”  
“This is like a being a kid at the fun fair again”  
He remarked and slid backwards down her silky smooth pin until he stopped at her ankle with his feet draped across the top of her foot.  
“Are they smooth enough Jack?”  
“Very smooth like glass”  
Summer lifted her foot up and raised Jack playfully with it.  
“Hey! Cut that out!”  
He laughed feeling like he was on the end of a giant seesaw that happened to be in the shape of slender giant woman’s leg.  
“I thought you wanted all the thrills of the fun fair”  
She giggled at how easily she could lift him.  
“I don’t think this ride is very safe”  
Summer lowered her foot to the carpet once more and Jack climbed off.  
“Ready for me to stand?”  
“I think so”  
Came his response feeling a little sensitive of his proximity to her high heeled shoes.  
“Time for me to show you how tiny you are, up I go”  
Now Jack was once more in the presence of a giantess standing barely as high as her ankles and able to peer under her skirt with ease from his current position, something Summer was fast to notice.  
“Nice view Jack?”  
“The best”  
“You are very little my shoes are nearly as tall as you are! I actually feel like a giant woman, this is what that Kara must have felt like walking around the city seeing little men at her feet it’s a very powerful sensation to feel so big”  
“Don’t move Summer”  
He requested and walked under her legs between then and around them looking at her shoes that reached up to his chest.  
“These are serious high heels, how do you walk on these?”  
“Very carefully with a little man at my feet”  
She laughed down watching him circle her shoes below.  
“You could probably walk under these heels if you were a little smaller like this”  
The shoes began to rise slowly blocking his view and pushing her ankles skyward until he was peering up at the arch of her heels.   
“Hey!”  
He playfully snapped not expecting another shrinking session so soon and finding himself less than the seven inch heels.   
“First you’re a slide and now you’re a tunnel, my girlfriend is an adventure playground”  
Jack said as he walked under each heel having fun with his new surroundings. It was so much nicer to be able to trust a giantess and even better to know this was Summer his girlfriend who was that giant woman.  
“Then lets have some more adventures tiny. Now you stand still”  
Jack froze stood facing her and between her shoes as Summer knelt down throwing him under the shadow of her skirt above. Quickly as her knees touched down like huge walls he walked out from between her legs to afford a view up to her face. A view that was partially blocked by her breasts from the angle he now looked.  
“May I pick you up Jack I’m dying to get my big hands on you”  
“Be gentle with me”  
He cautioned  
“Always”  
She comforted and clasped a great big hand around his middle allowing his head and shouldes to protrude whilst his feet dangled below.  
“You’re all warm and I can feel your heart beating like a little hamster, and so light”  
She held him up to her face.  
“Can I kiss you Summer?”  
“Why do you ask, of course silly”  
“Um in case you haven’t notice I can’t reach unless you bring me close to your lips”  
“Silly me, here help yourself”  
Jack looked at her lips probably spanning near four foot in width to him as she smiled. She had very kissable lips the sort that were wide and full and pronounced from her face as if she had invested in a subtle treatment with collagen but nothing was artificial about Summer she was all natural.  
“Your lips are beautiful and so….”  
”Big”  
She prompted and closed the gap until he was able to stretch across to place his tiny lips on just one of hers.  
“That was so sweet but you can’t call that a kiss? This is a kiss?”  
In contrast Summers lips took his entire face along with his neck and shoulders and wrapped across them with a wet smack that blew him away.  
“Remind me not to French kiss you when I’m this small Summer”  
Summer playfully grinned and then ran a finger upon his chest tracing it down to his stomach and back up again.  
“You know I could give you a really big love bite at this size one that stretches across this little chest of yours”  
Contemplating being the owner of the world largest hicky when she restored his full stature didn’t sound very appealing.  
“Ill pass please”  
“You’re no fun. How about checking the rest of your adventure playground out?”  
Summer teased and lay back on the floor stretching out and placing Jack on her waist.  
“Check out the obstacle course”  
The challenge was presented and Jack was up for some fun as he looked across her body and the red expanse of her tennis court sized blouse that was almost flat until it curved steeply upwards to contain her breasts, they were his obstacles.   
“You know I was top of my class for the assault course in basic training”  
Jack boasted and ran towards her breasts nearly slipping on her smooth blouse beneath his shoes as he confidently approached the twin red hills. He found that he was able to look over them and see Summers smiling features beyond.  
“No problem Ill be over these babies and kissing your giant lips again before you can say Jack Steele”  
“Really? My boobs must be far too small then. We can soon fix that, time to shrink Jacky boy”  
With a tease in her words Jack watched those red hills rise up to his face and then blot out his view of Summer until he began to start looking up at them as they grew and grew. They instantly became wider, fuller and so much higher before him until they were many times his size and so was Summer.  
She had lost sight of Jack and simple pointed the ring from above over her breasts focusing to make him so small that she would shake that cocky tone from his confident boasts.  
“Hey, enough!”  
His voice squeaked from behind her boobs and Summer giggled.  
“I thought shrinking you down might improve my cup size baby what do you think are they a challenge yet?”  
“I thought this was an assault course not a mountain climb!”  
Jack surveyed the vast steep blouse covered giants that he now faced and gulped a little at how small Summer had reduced him. Looking at the buttons on her blouse that trailed over those magnificent celebrations of the female form he realised he was close to the size of just one button and perhaps half an inch tall!  
“I can’t see you and I can hardly hear you sweetie you will have to come up here if you can make it over my E cups that is”  
Again a booming giggle thundered from her mouth to Jacks ears  
“Oh and that’s E for enormous to you my half inch boyfriend”  
From experience Jack knew scaling breasts this size was futile especially encased in such a smooth exterior but leaping from button to button and climbing the centre would be possible. Soon he made his way to the top of her v neck and stood there taking in the view of her breasts curving out in a very seductive fashion. He knew Summer was packing some great treasures beneath her top but he hadn’t figured she was this well endowed and giant sized as they appeared he was on top of a very deep valley.  
“Hi little guy”  
Summer whispered frightened she might blow him off or hurt his ears to speak any louder.  
“You are so dinky look at you Jack, I think that I may have over done it. You look like a little bug stood on my boobs up there.”  
Jack grew to twice his height and folded his arms.  
“So what’s my reward for meeting the challenge?”  
“You get to play in the big hills”  
Summer laughed and pushed her bust upwards unsettling Jack and tipping him forward until he softly bounced on top of one breast and then the other landing down between them just as she had planned. Summer then stood up letting him slide into the depths of her cleavage until he was trapped at the base of her bra. Walking to her bedroom she sniggered at him and felt very aroused by her power to overwhelm Jack with such a simple action. As she made it to her bedroom she sat on the bed peering down her top with a big smile.  
“You are so tiny in there, it’s a good job I’m not wearing a push up bra or you would be squished by now my little lover”  
“Looking around I don’t think you need a push up bra, these are huge!”  
“They are aren’t they”  
She boasted proud of her endowments.  
“and even more so since you slid that body of yours in between them”  
“What do you mean?”  
”Tell you what you’re a detective let me give you a hand so you can investigate inside a bra cup here and find out”  
Summers finger tips retrieved him and held open the side of her bra cup offering his body to explore within and Jack gladly entered realising she meant that her nipples had expanded since he came into to contact with her.   
“this tickles but its wonderful, you feel so good in there”  
Her commentary came as he crawled under the pressure of her bra cup and over acres of her curving breast to find her nipple in the warm darkness.  
“Oooh! what ever you just did is driving me wild!”  
Summer quivered to his touch as Jack hugged against the girth of her nipple kissing and caressing it.  
“Hold on little guy this bra’s coming off I’ve got to see you on my boobs, this is so erotic!”  
Unbuttoning her blouse to push her great breasts out Summer noticed the little bump of her miniscule boyfriend in the centre of her right cup. Carefully she reached behind her back and unhooked her bra moving herself backwards onto the bed so Jack didn’t fall to his death from the height of her chest. Jack stood up and pushed the net like surface of the bra material over his head exposing her nipple and himself with half the breast now revealed. Summer could see her little man stood behind a nipple that with the aid of her aroused state was reaching up to his stomach level.  
“Summer you have such sexy breasts”  
He complimented as he leaned down to kiss the end of her nipple and began licking inside its indentations.  
“Do you find them even sexier when they are giant sized to you Jack?”  
“What man could resist a pair of thirty foot tits, I’m in love”  
“Then why resist them Jack, make love to my breast let me feel your little dick enter my nipple its big enough and that would really turn me on right now”  
Summer was already breathless in her words and Jack was astonished at her invitation yet intrigued by it all the same, could he really loose himself in the end of this great nipple of hers?”  
“I need to be a little bigger your nipples just a little too tall”  
He requested and Summer granted his wish raising him to one and half inches and now her nipple was at his mercy as he removed his trousers and wrestled his hardness from out of his boxer shorts.  
“I don’t want you any taller Jack , I want my boob to be your lover, your mistress, I want you to rape my giant breast with all of your little body upon it. That would be so sexy…..so very sexy!”  
  
Jack didn’t hesitate and positioned himself straddling her nipple and pushing his member into it, he rubbed around the surface which felt nice and giving until he found a recess that took him all much to his surprise.  
“Oh yes!”  
He let himself go, and pumped hard down into her even managing to shake the whole platform of her breast beneath his feet. Summers hands had fallen beneath her skirt and she was getting off on both what Jack was doing and her own masturbation.  
“That’s it, go for it Jack. Make love to my giant sexy breasts, be rough, as rough as you want little man!”  
Jack banged away like a mad man, hard as he could manage and in a manor that would have harmed any woman at his normal size yet Summers giant nipple took the punishment and turned it into pleasure for them both. Very soon he exploded into her flesh and then slumped down onto her aerola hardly reaching across this darker skin even with his legs and arms fully stretched out. Summer had achieved the same result and lay panting catching her breath feeling the little blob of warm liquid that now settled in the indent of her nipple which acted as a reminder of this terrific sex.  
“I should have been born a giantess”  
Summer sighed  
“I can’t describe how good that was my nipples are always so sensitive Jack and you just blessed that one with the greatest sensations I’ve ever had. I love you my little man”  
He was lifted from her breast and kissed once more and even cleaned up by her giant tongue all in one go.  
  
“Guess its time we went to bed Jack its awfully late and I bet you want to rebuild you life starting tomorrow.”  
Summer said undressing and placing just her red blouse back on and nothing else. She looked amazing and Jack wolf whistled from her bedside unit.   
“You look so hot Summer I’m so sorry I didn’t make a move on you before”  
“Ssssh Jack that’s in the past, we have the rest of our lives to make it up now don’t we?”  
“Yeh”  
“I’m going to get a glass of water before I retire what about you?”  
”Sure I could use one, well a thimble anyway”  
She grinned and then with a reluctant tone offered  
“Guess I should grow you back now, are you ready?”  
“I could handle a few more minutes in the company of my beautiful giant girlfriend  
especially if she lets me do something”  
“and what would that be my little lover?”  
Summer said looming over the bed side unit with her blouse offering a nice glimpse of her  
heavy bare breasts jiggling beneath as they jutted out considerably with the aid of gravity to swell them.  
“Id like to ride in that pocket up there on your blouse for the trip”  
“Oh would you now?”  
She teased looking into her breast pocket as if to assess the potential.  
“Well you are certainly small enough to fit in this big pocket of mine but you will have to behave I’m not wearing a bra you know and I can get easily aroused”  
Playfully she lifted him and pretended to place him in her cleavage gently brushing his body to her breasts before altering his course to her pocket and dropping him inside.  
“I think that I’m gonna get to like using this ring on you and having a pocket sized boyfriend”  
“I certainly love the sizeable benefits it offers”  
Jack smiled up and hugged her blouse where it leaned upon the slope of her breast.  
“mmm, I could get used to this. Hold tight tiny without a bra the ride could be pretty wild for you”  
Summer giggled walking down the stairs to her kitchen to fix them both a drink.   
As she got to hallway at the base of the staircase a bright light pierced through the edges of the front door frame.  
“what the heck?”  
She backed away for a second and then moved to the side window to take a look but as the light faded she only glimpsed something large moving outside and around to her rear garden.  
“Jack, there is something out there”  
Jack couldn’t see at all he was far to deep in her pocket and surrounded in the deep red of her blouse material.  
“Careful honey it could be just some kids messing around”  
“What ever it was its now in the back garden”  
Carefully Summer moved through the house to the back door and unlocked it cautiously listening for anything out of the ordinary. The garden wasn’t well lit and stepping out onto the patio Summer could sense something was watching her from above. She peered up into the night sky and a dark shadow seemed to blot out some of the stars as a humming noise loomed ever closer. Suddenly the object that was hovering above her garden illuminated and it looked like a space ship!  
Frozen like a deer in the headlights of a car she just watched this machine lower until it was only a few feet from her position.   
“What is it? Summer what’s going on?”  
Jack piped up from her pocket but Summer smoothed her pocket over with her hand protectively to conceal Jack from harm effectively sealing him in.   
  
As she backed away the craft suddenly emitted a blue laser like beam that was directed at her and Summer feared she was going to die closing her eyes for a second as the light flowed over her body. But as she opened them again the beam had narrowed focusing upon her finger as it removed the ring!  
“No!”  
Summer barked in a panic jumping in the air to grab the ring that was being drawn back into the craft as the beam receded with it.   
Jack tumbled around like a rag doll in her pocket with her actions, he was worried what was going on outside of Summers blouse. With the ring having entered a small hatch in the belly of the craft another beam emitted a white light that converged to form the huge face of Kara hovering over Summer like a bill board yet fashioned from pure holographic energy.  
“Jack’s little girlfriend I might have known my ring would end up with you.”  
Jack almost trembled in the pocket imagining that Kara had returned her voice chilled him to the bone.  
“You must be Kara?”  
“Ah, I see my little pet Jack has been talking about his adventures. Well I wish that I could say hello in the flesh and finish the job I did on your house little lady but for now I’m much too large to travel to your time so I’m forced to use this remote operated probe. I’ve been trying to track that ring and my little pet down for the past week, where is Jack little girl I would like to talk to him”  
Jack began to shout out but Summer stifled his voice by folding her arms across her chest trying to hide him.  
  
  
##Part 19  
  
“Jack’s not here”  
“Well I only have limited power in this thing so it’s a shame I can’t hang around to deliver this message myself. Tell Jack I have my ring back now and in exactly seven hundred days time when this ring is fully functional his owner, his BIG owner is coming back to collect him so he’d better be waiting for me. Take care of my Jack for me wont you, and enjoy him while you can because he’ll be mine very soon”  
  
There was a long laugh as the probe swiftly rose up into the night sky and became as small as one of the stars in the distance before it disappeared.  
“Oh no”  
Summer shook her head and swallowed hard walking slowly back into her house. Jack had heard everything and understood what had just happened. Plucking him from her blouse pocket she held him in her hand and then against one of her massive cheeks upon her face in a comforting manor.  
Holding him before her eyes once more she waited for his reaction.  
“Well you had better scrap my comment I said earlier Summer”  
“What comment?”  
“When I said for the next two years I would be looking up to a very big girlfriend”  
“And now?”  
”Well now I’m gonna be looking up to a VERY, VERY big girlfriend”…………………….  
  
THE END
