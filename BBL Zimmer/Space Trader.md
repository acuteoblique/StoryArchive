#Space Trader  
by BBL
  
##Part 1

“Come on Tiffani please contact me” Zal waited anxiously gazing at his inactive com-crystal hoping that any minute now Tiffani’s delightful voice would sparkle the communications device into life.  
Waiting restlessly he glanced at his star navigation console and realized at least another three days traveling remained until he would reach the nearest space dock and unload his cargo. It was only his chats with Tiffani that made these long haul interstellar journeys bearable to him now as she seemed to bring some brightness into his dull existence as a Trader roaming through the star systems.  
  
Since he was fourteen like his father before him Zal had been encouraged to engage in the families business which forced his early familiarization with piloting a Star Freighter so he and his father could both scour the Universe for items of worth to offer for trade at the Tallion exchange posts . Zal didn’t much care for the constant weeks he endured hyper-thrusting from star system to star system to make a living but he had to admit that he did get to see some pretty cool new planets and meet a lot of differing alien cultures which made life a little more interesting. But the most intriguing and dominant presence in Zal’s life for the past 3 years was Tiffani, a female humanoid residing on a less advanced planet on the outer rim that his father labeled as “Terra” which Zak had later discovered from Tiffani was actually known by its inhabitants as “Earth”.  
Infact Zal had his father directly to thank for his contact with Tiffani although Zal never let his father know about his secret friend as Earth was labeled by his father on the prohibited list of planets that all Tallion Traders should not visit. His father never talked much about his experiences almost a decade ago on Earth other than to say it was not a technologically advanced race there and perhaps two or more centuries behind their own development. But what he did adamantly state was that under no circumstances should a fellow Trader land there as it was a hostile world beyond compare and full of danger. It was upon this very trip to earth that his father in his haste to retreat to his ship lost a com-crystal which was later discovered by Tiffani luckily for Zal.  
  
Zal held the large crystal in his hand anticipating Tiffani’s contact its clear almost dazzling exterior glowed softly to his touch as contact with the bio-heat energy from a living being powered the crystals unique abilities. These crystals were a phenomenon to Tallion Prime the home world of Zal and his family, they would grow abundantly in pairs sprouting out of the rugged terrain by the coastal regions and each pair shared a unique life long bond when parted. By holding one of the com-crystals in your hand when another human did the same it would link the crystals regardless of distance to allow hyper audio waves to be transmitted and received between them , literally making a limitless ranged two way communications device that offered space explorers instant contact to home without any latency unlike any artificially created medium of its kind. The crystals had been the first true export from Tallion Prime at the exchange posts for other species but due to the fact that only two individuals could communicate and not a network they soon lost appeal to the military for being far too limited in application.  
  
“Zal are you there?”  
Tiffani’s sweet voice broke the hum of the Freighters drive engines.  
“Tiffani”  
he responded with obvious pleasure in his voice.  
“Great your there , Im sorry I was a bit late today calling you but its my eighteenth birthday next week and Corrina was discussing a plan for us to check out an over twenty ones night club”  
“I remembered it was your birthday I have got it marked in my auto-logger , tell me what is this night club a place where you Earth humans view the stars? An observatory of some description?”  
“Oh Zal you are funny”  
she giggled  
“No it’s a place where people a little older than myself and Corrina go to dance and drink and well generally have a good time , im not really allowed in at 17 but I can look a lot older when Im really dressed up”  
“Sounds like the social areas at space port but we get genetically scanned so we cant lie about our ages and I cant how do you say? Hang out there until im 19 cycles old , oh I mean years to you”  
“Do Tallions dance Zal?, I would love to dance with you one day..”  
“Sure we dance Tiffani its fun but disappointingly even in social gatherings our women only wear full body outfits , so I guess its not nearly as exciting to watch as on Earth where you can bare your flesh for all to see in those skirts and dresses you told me about …is that what you will wear next week?”  
“Zal picture this, ive got the shortest little mini skirt and a tight little red crop top that would drive you wild”  
  
Tiffani and Zal found each other by accident when Zal picked up his fathers old crystal as Tiffani was examining the other one. From their early teens at that time the two of them had bonded instantly and once overcoming the initial realization and surprise from Tiffani that she was conversing with an alien they had kept touch on almost a daily basis. Over several years they formed a long distance relationship sharing confidences and secrets and teaching each other about their very different ways of life. As they both progressed through puberty their conversations became more flirty and often very open and teasing as they became more sexually aware. Although Zal hadn’t ever met or seen Tiffani he knew Tallions and humans were very similar in genetic make up by description. Both humanoid and like the majority of the aliens his race had encountered to date, their language was almost identical except for some terminology that both of them were still learning, additionally their appreciation of time distance and measurement was also very much the same from what they had learned between them. A year on Tallion Prime was a full 365 days rotation of their binary star and for Earth a comparable orbit of what humans called the Sun a single star that Zal had seen on his Navigation computers charts once or twice in his travels.  
It was the cultural differences that really intrigued Zal about Earth , on his planet women covered their whole bodies except their faces when in public and wore mainly plain body suits of different fabrics and colours and would only reveal themselves in privacy to their lovers. When Tiffani first told him that human females regularly displayed their legs and figures in dresses and skirts sometimes intentionally drawing attention to their bodies he became very excited at this news.  
“Does this mini skirt show your thighs Tiffani?”  
He openly questioned with his imagination running wild  
“you bet ya Zal you can almost see my underwear when I bend over! Corrina thinks it’s a little too short but it does make my legs look longer and if I have to go out with miss legs up to her arm pits then at least I might compete a little”  
“Corrina has no body then Tiffani? I didn’t realise some of you Earth girls differed like that I don’t think she would look very visually appealing or hot , yes hot that’s what you say inst it. Not a hot babe?”  
There was a pause as Tiffani registered what Zal was misunderstanding and she laughed.  
“No , no Zal you are so literal sometimes you dummy , legs up to her arm pits its an expression that she is very tall , she’s got very long legs compared to me and yes she is what you would call a babe I only wish I had her legs”  
Zal laughed at his mistake.  
“But you measure 5 foot 6 inches Tiffani that’s tall, I don’t think I have told you before but Tallion girls only grow to a genetically preset 5ft 4inches tall , aren’t you happy with your stature ?”  
“Yeh I guess, I mean my legs have a nice shape and all but I kind of thought I would grow a little taller I would have liked to be 5 foot 9 like my mum or 6ft even like Corrina?”  
“She is 6ft! Wow! 6ft I have never seen any girl or woman that size that would be something”  
Zal admitted. As Tiffani had found out Tallions are very honest almost to a fault and Zal never got shy of telling her his inner most thoughts.  
“I think a 6ft woman would be amazing to see Tiffani I mean actually taller than me it would be incredible”  
Tiffani went a little quite she was somehow jealous that her extra terrestrial friend also found the sound of her close friends height attractive.  
“Yeh she is something but I can equal her size in a pair of my high heels”  
“You have footwear on earth that is designed to elevate your own height?”  
Zal was beginning to grow more excited , Earth sounded like a wonderful place to visit if Tiffani was anything to go by. On Tallion men and women were all born with their physical appearances set by the genetics technology and ultimate height and weight of both genders was predetermined to make clothes production more efficient and as there was no such thing as fashion Earth sounded so incredibly diverse to him.  
“Yes haven’t I told you about high heels? Well unlike you Tallion’s most Earth girls are obsessed with shoes matching our outfits and if we want to make ourselves a little taller we simply slip some high heels on , so I could be 2 inches taller than you if I wanted as well”  
“This is so amazing Tiffani, forgive me but I have always dreamed of seeing a taller woman than myself I think im a bit strange amongst my friends they all accept and seem happy with our women and their size but when I was thirteen cycles old I once visited space port 7 with my father and saw an Altoxian couple. They are humanoid like us and they set their genetic code like we do only in reverse so this woman was taller than him by several inches and I could never shake the vision of him looking up to her it stirred something inside me”  
“I didn’t know you had a thing for tall girls Zal if we do ever meet remind me to wear a pair of heels for you and I had better not tell Corrina to come over or you might find her more attractive than me”  
“Yes I do love the idea of taller girls Tiffani but on my planet it is an impossibility, but even with Corrina’s height I am sure your body would seize my full attention in comparison”  
Zal’s mind drifted to his other obsession in women.  
“Ah my chest. Yes they are still growing larger and she hasn’t got half my cleavage even now”  
Tiffani boasted, and once more Zal was turned on by his mental image of Tiffani. He loved the female form and especially breasts he had been fascinated listening over the years as Tiffani discovered hers and how she described her body taking on the form of a woman. Tiffani knew his passion for breasts and how the sheer idea that cleavage could be displayed by a girl on Earth through clothing without causing any social alarm excited him a great deal.  
  
Zal had a couple of relationships in the past with Tallion girls but he found them so reserved compared to Tiffani and how he was able to chat with her.  
“Your gonna get me going Tiffani if you keep on about your breasts”  
“You love it really Zal your gonna have to update your what was it called? The Holo-simulation of me with my new vital statistics”  
Using a 4 dimensional projector Zal had programmed a holographic image of what he understood Tiffani to look like based on her descriptions. As they spoke he initiated the virtual image and before him on the piloting deck stood his approximation of Tiffani. She was a very beautiful girl and completely natural. Her waist for her size was very slim and yet her hips held a strong contrast tapering down to her shapely legs. Her taught stomach and slim upper body again helped to emphasize her larger than average bust which combined with her waist and hip measurements meant that she had a very sexy body indeed to lure Zals eyes. Her face was perfect with a small nose clear skin , and large pretty green eyes. A virtual mane of golden blonde hair settled on her shoulders and down to the small of her back. He stood before the semi transparent projection and imagined her with higher footwear looking him in the eyes and he grew more aroused.  
“Your are beautiful Tiffani I am looking at you now, I have spent many pleasurable hours looking at this holo-image I have created”  
“Hey Zal….”  
Tiffani began in a sexy voice  
“Do you, you know play with yourself when you look at it?”  
Zal didn’t hesitate to answer  
“Yes , in my mind we have made love many times and for Tallion males if we don’t have a partner we have to perform the deliverance sometimes up to 5 occasions a day or we suffer the burning”  
“The deliverance you mean masturbating? 5 times a day!”  
Tiffani fell into fits of laughter.  
“no way!”  
  
##Part 2  
  
“Yes is this not normal for your men also?”  
“err I don’t think so. I mean, I guess some guys play with themselves a lot but every day, and sometimes up to 5 times a day! man that’s obsessive you Tallions must be extremely horny!”  
“Our sexual appetites are great Tiffani but its important that from puberty we execute the deliverance when needed as the burning is painful to us.”  
“What? its like accepted that you have to do it”  
“Yes, its important our seed is renewed constantly and if we do not relieve it our seed will become impossible to tolerate within us its very painful, when I reach 40 cycles it goes down to 2 times but it is normal in the last years of our education domains , schools as you term them, that we have private chambers made for this purpose. “  
“I couldn’t imagine that at my old school”  
She chuckled to herself at the mere thought of the boys sloping off to play with themselves between lessons.  
“Guys here don’t really talk or admit to masturbating Zal its kind of a taboo subject when women are around and in general”  
“Then they are not proud of their sexual prowess Tiffani? I thought Earth was so much more liberated than Tallion Prime”  
”I guess we are in some ways , anyhow now you’ve got that holo thingy running Ive got an update for you that I think you’ll appreciate”  
Zal waited looking at the static projected image before him of Tiffani.  
“Ive had to buy a load of new bra’s this week seems I’ve gone up a cup size. My boobs still seem to be growing and that’s almost two cup sizes extra in the last 6 to 8 months”  
Back to the wonderful topic of her body and her breasts Zal thought as he looked at her already ample form.  
“What is this bra? You have mentioned these before Tiffani are they measuring devices for your breasts?”  
“No silly a bra is a piece of women’s clothing made of material that is designed to support our boobs”  
“Fascinating and you suspend them in this bra thing”  
Tiffani found him amusing..  
“ Well they are all different colours and materials some are made to lift our boobs and some push our cleavage up to make it more sexy, but basically they control our boobs from bouncing to much when we walk or run especially well blessed girls like me”  
“I would love to see these bras they sound very sexy our women don’t wear these material dressings they have tiny implants under the skin of the breasts that draw power from the body and lift the breasts with gravity compensators”  
“eew! That sounds horrible”  
“Its normal you cannot notice them I think our women have them implanted when they are twelve”  
“Ill stick to my bra’s thanks , if we ever get to meet remind me to show you one…..Zal my mums coming upstairs I have to go lets speak tomorrow”  
Tiffani offered a kiss to the crystal and then silence once again fell. Zal walked around the image of Tiffani and leaned down to kiss the holograms lips but with no substance it was a frustrating action.  
He so longed to meet Tiffani to spend some time on Earth but was fearful of his fathers wrath if he ever ventured into that part of space. What was it that his father found so dangerous about Earth they didn’t seem like barbarians if Tiffani was anything to go by? One day he thought, one day I will visit this Earth.  
  
A few days past by and Tiffani and Zal discussed everything and anything as usual. It was at the start of the next week that Zal was on yet another trip this time as close to the outer rim as he had ever been. He was returning from Cybrox a very distant moon where his father had found deposits of Zintaxium a highly unstable energy source that required special handling but fetched a very good price for traders brave enough to transport it. Normally his father would handle these trips but he had become ill last week, nothing serious but Zal was asked to step in with his fathers full confidence in his abilities. Zal as usual was bored and was tinkering with the trim of the flight attitude controls when his display panels lit up like a christmas tree as the ships fire containment system had engaged automatically. The main computer announced.  
“Warning. Warning. Containment breech cargo pod 5. “  
the synthetic voice bellowed with an urgency about it.  
“active fire systems engaged. Immediate Jettison advised.”  
“No way!”  
Zal shouted and looked at the panel read out the Zintaxium had leaked from its carriers and erupted into a plasmatic fire melting the pods skin . The trouble with plasmatic fires was that the vacuum of space wouldn’t extinguish them. Zal hated to loose cargo but his ship would be in peril if the other cargo pods exploded as a consequence of the blaze raging in the outer pod. Like lightning he reacted and released the securing clamps to the pod and it began to drift away but as it did so there was a massive explosion. The view screen flashed up with a blinding white light and the shockwave unsettled the ship throwing Zal from his command chair and sending him sprawling across the deck. The stability gyros had failed and his ship wildly veered around out of control. Staggering to his feet and reaching the main control console he began shutting down major systems to protect them and tried to get the craft stable. After a frantic few minutes his efforts paid off and the freighter was steady. Zal surveyed the damage to the ship from the blast it had rendered his main propulsion module off line and that was serious he couldn’t hyper thrust without it and that would mean decades to return to home rather than days! Fortunately Zal knew his way around engines because his father had taught him well but the extent of the damage was to the engine shielding reflector plates and that wasn’t something he could repair without finding some replacement materials. He looked at his options a distress call on conventional stellar space bands would invite pirates, there were some notorious pirates who preyed on the freighters and this was the last thing he needed as he could no longer out run them. Calling back to Tallion later that day on his home com-crystal he was pleased to hear his mother answer. Having explained his predicament he assured her somehow he would repair the ship to make his way home but for now he was stuck out in the farthest regions of deep space. Zal turned his attention to finding some Trelan metal, he had the tools onboard to fashion the shielding but he couldn’t make the reflector plates unless he could find a reasonable amount of Trelan.  
“Computer activate wide field detectors, search for traces of Trelan deposits”  
The computer performed its task efficiently and reported  
“ Source Located star grid reference 459 vector 6”  
He checked his navigational array and was shocked to find the detected source of Trelan emanated from Tiffani’s planet.  
“Earth? Computer verify detector accuracy”  
“Detectors working within normal parameters”  
Zal contemplated the situation for a second and then smiled and muttered to himself  
“well Tiffani it looks like we are gonna meet after all”  
With his new target destination set he sped under the power of his sub light motion engines towards Earth with many thoughts traveling through his mind but namely the danger his father relayed that it was an inhospitable planet and the compelling thought of meeting Tiffani for real. He looked at himself in a reflector panel , he was tall and muscular and in general great physical condition he felt pretty confident that Tiffani would find him attractive.  
  
Later that day Zal had calculated when he would enter Earths atmosphere it was now less than a days full travel. His conversation that evening with Tiffani was very exciting for them both as he explained his predicament and his plans to visit Earth.  
“I cant believe it Zal your gonna be here like Sunday evening that’s so fantastic!”  
“Tiffani Im also looking forward to meeting you but there are some practical things I need to sort out first”  
“Such as?”  
“Where I can land for starters , I need to repair my ship and its pretty big it’s a class 2 freighter”  
“ Like I know what a class 2 freighter is Zal , so how big is this ship?”  
“Lets just say its big enough to cause attention on a planet that hasn’t seen interstellar vehicles before, which is why Im gonna launch an advanced communications holo scout from here it will allow me to gauge suitable areas for a landing site , I will send it to you first by locking on your com-crystal location is that ok?”  
“Erm what’s this scout thingy look like will it scare my folks because they don’t know about you and having a piece of alien hardware drop out of the sky wont go unnoticed “  
She sounded a little nervous.  
“Its ok Tiffani I can shield the scout from view it has refractive stealth shielding so until it finds you it won’t reveal itself visibly that is”  
“Ok and when do I expect this thing?”  
“In about 3 hours time”  
“Ok that’s 7pm tonight so Ill make sure im in the park away from the house. Oh Zal this is so cool my own close encounter , you just wait till you get here there is so much to show you and even if you repair that ship of yours quickly Im not letting you go until you come out with me and Corrina on my birthday ok?”  
“Im looking forward to it”  
They tailed off their conversation each anticipating the events to come, the hours rolled past and Tiffani was in the park sat on a children’s swing waiting for Zal’s scout to arrive. The park was empty and she was thankful for that as she peered up into the evening sky. Suddenly from behind she heard a sound which disturbed her. She twisted around and witnessed a glowing red sphere dramatically appear from no where and it hovered gently suspended above her head. Then it spoke to her or rather Zal’s voice projected through it.  
“Tiffani I hope your there Im just having to calibrate this scouts visual imaging systems they don’t seem to work well on your planet they seem to want more power”  
“Wow Zal is that really you speaking through that thing?”  
“What other aliens do you know Tiffani?”  
She laughed and then watched as the device emitted a holographic image of Zal stood before her , through this ghost like 3D projection Zal could use all his senses as he controlled the remote scout from the ship. Both of them just stared at each other for several lingering seconds in pure fascination of the situation.  
“Tiffani you are gorgeous as breathtaking as the images I have created of you”  
She blushed and studied the holographic representation of Zal and smiled back at him with equal appreciation.  
“And you are a real fox Zal I always hoped that you would be good looking but your like dreamy”  
Tiffani wished she hadn’t said that as it sounded so corny but she felt a little overcome with his good looks.  
Zal was dressed in his flight suit a spandex style material that hugged his well formed muscular frame and she bit her lower lip as she eyed him up. For Zal she was stunning a breathe of fresh air from Tallion women and he instantly noticed that the holographic image he had created of her based on descriptions was not a touch on the real girls true beauty. Even more noticeable to Zal was that she was had a considerably larger and more prominent chest than he had dreamed of which excited him a great deal. They both noted the instant attraction between themselves and Tiffani tried not to stare at his good looks.  
“Tiffani I hope this scout didn’t frighten you when it approached?”  
“No I err didn’t actually hear it coming until the last minute, listen Zal where will you land tomorrow I want to make sure im there to meet you”  
Tiffani couldn’t wait to meet Zal anymore he everything she imagined and more , not only was he great to talk to he was great to look at. She also hoped he would find her up to his expectations and seeing his expression conveyed in real-time on the hologram she was pretty sure that she did. Sending out a survey pulse from the scout Zal studied the 3D telemetry he was receiving of the terrain in the area.  
“Tiffani there seems to be some waste land close to this location but my read outs are not providing me with any form of distance or measurement but im registering some debris from construction …”  
“The old power plant , yes that’s ideal no one goes there its just deserted since they pulled the buildings down and its in a secluded area with an old track leading to it by the little lake Corrina and I sometimes go to. Its about half a mile from here and perhaps over a mile from my house. If you land there no one should bother you and your ship.”  
She assured.  
“I can camouflage the ships outer hull Tiffani from unwanted eyes and avoid detection from your satellites. I will meet you there in the evening if you carry the com-crystal I should be able to lock on to your signal and find you”  
“That’s great”  
she beamed eagerly.  
“will you sleep in the ship whilst your here?”  
“I suppose staying at your domicile I mean house, yes house would be out of the question?”  
“sorry Zal , mum and dad wouldn’t like a guy staying over. Im practically eighteen and wish I had my own place but as for now I have to suffer my parents rules”  
“no problem as long as we can socialize together and I can see some of the wonderful things we’ve talked about.”  
“I cant wait”  
  
##Part 3  
  
The scout receded into the sky ten minutes later with their conversations over and Sunday evening came around very rapidly. Zals ship entered the atmosphere of Earth using his technology to shield it from the primitive detection devices so he wouldn’t cause alarm. Descending to the old power plant area he set the large craft down gently and instructed his computer.  
“computer scan for humanoid life forms one mile radius”  
“one humanoid female detected bearing 345 vector 1”  
“Tiffani”  
he smiled to himself and checked his appearance he was actually going to meet her this angel from another planet. How should he great her a hug a kiss an offer of his hand , he didn’t know and was a little nervous.  
“Tiffani you there?”  
He spoke expectantly into the com crystal.  
“Zal where are you im here waiting”  
“I think I have you on tracking Tiffani you should be able to see the freighter your so close”  
“nope? Is it like invisible or something?”  
She stared at the rubble remains before and around her.  
“No my camouflage systems aren’t active but you should have line of sight”  
“nothing?”  
“that’s odd”  
Zal said secretly wanting to impress her with his huge spacecraft. Suddenly there was a disturbance outside the ship as if the ground was experiencing a set of tremors and Zal grabbed hold of a hand rail.  
“Tiffani what was that! Are you ok? The land here seems to geologically unstable and full of seismic activity it just rocked my ship”  
He was worried thinking this must be an unstable landmass perhaps his father meant that it was inhospitable due to this reason alone.  
“Zal what are you talking about? An earthquake?”  
“Is that a tremor in your world when the land shifts under tectonic stress? If so yes , it was a small earthquake but its subsided now”  
“you cant be in the same place Zal its quiet here Im just stood looking around at nothing but concrete and rubble”  
“Im coming out to look for you Tiffani stay still”  
He thumbed the boarding steps and they emerged extending out as the real air swirled into his cockpit. Walking out he clutched his protector on his belt it was a stun weapon that was standard issue for Traders such as himself. Walking out there was a dusty mass of huge metal and man made wreckage from structures as Tiffani had indicated and he walked around his craft and about a hundred feet in the direction the humanoid detection was made. As he rounded a large section of concrete like a broken wall beside him he suddenly saw a scary sight something absolutely gigantic was the other side of the broken wall.  
“Tiffani he whispered there is some enormous monster here I didn’t see all of it. It looked like an omni-ped of some description that has encased its massive foot in some black animal fabric formed into some huge tower, its massive and I think its what caused the earthquake as it moved. You never mentioned such incredibly huge creatures roaming your planet before?”  
Zal hid for a moment conscious this beast may find his ship if it wasn’t camouflaged. He also realized these monsters may have been the very reason his father ruled out Earth as a place to visit and trade with. Tiffani was totally confused now an earthquake then a monster?  
“Zal what are you talking about?”  
Zal was breathless for a moment he heard her words not only coming through the large com crystal in his hand but also from above like a loud speaker? He glanced again seeing an incredible sight the black towering object was actually a boot like none he had ever seen and as big as a Nabrian freighter and coming out of it was a long bare leg, he looked to the side and there was another identical one! It wasn’t an omni-ped it was a colossal bi-ped humanoid! Up still his eyes traveled and he couldn’t believe them, before him was a giantess a being of immense proportions a beautiful female that towered in the evening sky above like the high rise dwellings in Tallion central. He watched as the giantess looked around her long blonde hair swaying in the breeze and then studying her face so far above partly obscured by the immense bust of this female he realized with a shock this giant woman was Tiffani! Zal couldn’t believe what he saw, his instruments in the ship hadn’t offered him any warning that his perception of size would be so utterly and fundamentally different to that of Tiffani’s. All those years he had longed to meet her , wondering how truly beautiful she was and now the day had finally come and he was standing there before her all two hundred foot of her or at least this was his best guess. Tiffani the girl of his dreams was a giant an alien female that had legs measuring well over one hundred of his own feet!  
What should he do? He felt scared in her presence it was natural she was so immense compared to him and he realized one slight movement of her foot would easily and accidentally press his tiny body into the ground like an insect beneath the huge soles of her shoes, shuddering at this thought he fled and made back to his ship.  
“Zal? Are you ok? Speak to me Zal I cant see any monsters , where are you?”  
He heard his com crystal beg for his attention as he made it to the boarding ramp. Sitting in his cockpit laying back in his command chair he breathed out heavily with relief as his heart thumped away. Then he struck the control panel before him offloading some of his frustration that he was but an insignificant spec to this gorgeous creature. Feeling vulnerable he activated the camouflage system and waited, in a few seconds her voice sounded very concerned and he could feel her walking close to the ship as it rocked gently.  
“Zal please speak to me are you alright?”  
He decided to answer  
“Tiffani…Im err fine yeh ok.”  
“whats going on?”  
”I don’t know how to tell you this but I don’t think it was a good idea for me to visit you on Earth im gonna have to leave and find somewhere else that has Trelan for my repairs”  
In reality he knew this would be a very remote possibility to find any Trelan without his hyperthrust drive.  
“why? Zal your not making any sense I thought you were gonna meet me here and see some of this planet , Zal I really do want to meet you more than anything”  
Her words touched both his heart.  
“Tiffani I….”  
He didn’t know what to say.  
“Zal when I saw that image you projected of yourself , you appeared to be everything I ever dreamed and imagined you would be , did I disappoint you somehow? Is that why you won’t see me and made up this monster excuse?”  
“No, Tiffani you don’t understand your perfect, gorgeous the most beautiful girl I have seen across a hundred galaxies its…”  
Tiffani smiled at his comment and played with a strand of her long blonde hair as she sat down on a broken section of wall to rest staring down into the com-crystal in her fingers.  
“then if you like what you saw why wont you meet with me? Zal I feel such a unique connection between us more than any guy I’ve ever known and Idd like…Zal please ”  
She didn’t finished her sentence and Zal considered his options , on Theta Seven he had braved a tunnel full of five foot Zentarian ridge spiders and on Alias Central he had stared down a Thunder Demon who was after his cargo and here he was on Earth intimidated by the thought of meeting a mere woman. He flicked on an exterior view screen and found part of Tiffani in the distance it was her giant bare legs and he scanned upwards to the full extent of the exterior panning units until he could just see part of her beautiful features , her two huge green eyes and large red painted lips surrounded by her long blonde hair. He knew he had to pluck the courage to expose himself to her and see her reaction rather than cower like a Dennibrox fowl in his spaceraft.  
“Tiffani I should explain I owe you that much and then you have a choice if you still wish to see me or not”  
“please go ahead Zal”  
“Tiffani I didn’t lie to you , I initially thought that I had seen a monster the description I gave you was of your boot that I saw”  
“My boot?”  
Tiffani looked down at her feet and the knee high fashionable boots she wore in a confused manor.  
“The tremors I felt in my ship it was you who made them”  
”Me? Zal im not following I haven’t even seen your ship yet?”  
“Perhaps this will explain , look to your left about 10 feet to your perspective im deactivating the ships exterior camouflage system”  
She stared into the distance and then up into the air and all around when a quivering in the air caught her eye like the shimmer of a heat haze before suddenly a metallic object began to piece into view like a jigsaw materializing bit by bit. The craft was 3 foot long and about 2 foot tall in the centre with a peculiar shape that offered no initial clue to the front or back. Tiffani stood up and drew closer very slowly she waited expecting more of the spacecraft to appear deciding this must be its landing gear materializing first but nothing else emerged. She looked quizzically at the object barely past her knees in height and she spoke to Zal.  
“Zal what’s going on this little model like thing has just come out of nowhere is it part of your ship another scout type thingy only bigger?”  
“Tiffani what your looking at is my class 2 freighter which normally is pretty impressive but…”  
“but Zal this things tiny its smaller than a car, its smaller than some children’s pedal cars you cant be serious”  
She gave a small laugh.  
“Tiffani we Tallion’s don’t lie your looking at my ship and normally I would expect you to be looking up at it in awe but then you forgot to tell me in all these years that , well your clearly descended from a race of giants”  
Tiffani burst out laughing and knew this had to be his alien humor.  
“giants, good one Zal! you do make me laugh is this another one of your holo projection thingy’s”  
With that she stepped to the ship and crouched down before it and expected to pass her hand straight through it when her hand collided with the top surface and slightly jolted the craft.  
“woah! What the!”  
She heard the reaction from Zal who was flung nearly out of his chair again.  
“Oh god, its real! Oops Zal erm, Zal did I break anything?”  
Zal recovered to his seat and looking at the view screen all he could see was part of her flesh filling the display as she leaned down over the ship.  
“Tiffani please step back a little will you”  
He watched the view change as she retreated back on her heels slightly, still crouching and he saw the black v neck of her top begin to outline the flesh, it was her cleavage that had blocked the display! He gasped and then shook his head in disbelief at the enormous size of Tiffani’s shape filling out her tight clothing. This accidental glimpse of her womanly charms was both surprising and highly stimulating to Zal at the same time and he suddenly realized that he would actually be smaller than just one of those massive breasts.  
“You are so enormous Tiffani”  
“Zal your not kidding are you? I mean your saying that this little thing is your spaceship and that means”  
She paused before she committed her next words.  
“your actually inside it?”  
Looking down at the craft Tiffani shook her head.  
“no that’s impossible”  
She concluded  
“no one could actually fit inside this small thing you would be all hunched up”  
Zal noted the reference “small”, his freighter was anything but small , well to him anyway.  
“That’s what Im trying to tell you. Tiffani you’re a giantess”  
She paused contemplating what he had said , could a man, could Zal really be in there?  
“Me a giantess that’s funny”  
Her mind refused to entertain such a preposterous thought.  
“Tiffani why didn’t you warn me ,why didn’t you tell me earth women are so gigantic, im on a planet full of two hundred foot females and I don’t even want to think about the males on your planet”  
“Zal what are you talking about 200 foot ,im not even six foot tall!”  
“Tiffani we seem to share the same terminology for measurement but your 5ft 6 inches looks like 200 feet you are incredibly huge!”  
Tiffani could tell the conversation had passed the amusing stage and that her good looking alien friend was telling the truth and the thought of seeing a man short enough to squeeze into the small craft below made her curious.  
“Zal please come out so I can see you”  
Her tone was gentle and Zal took a deep breathe should he go out there and confront a beautiful alien of impossible proportions? He was nervous but this was Tiffani after all the woman of his dreams.  
“I err don’t think that’s wise it’s a big world out there and if you are so huge then you may have many animal species native to your world that could endanger me”  
Tiffani became more curious to the real size of Zal was he just nervous or scared even to meet her?  
  
##Part 4  
  
“Look Zal if im such a giant then I can protect you I promise nothing will harm you out here, listen just how tall do you think you are?”  
“Tiffani im 5ft 10 inches tall but here on your planet I can’t be anymore than….”  
He looked at her image once more and gulped a little  
“….two or three inches tall”  
There was a silence as this registered with Tiffani.  
”Oh god your Tom Thumb from outer space”  
“Tom who?”  
”Never mind Zal. Look if you are really that tiny I know that I must look pretty monstrous, I mean you wouldn’t even reach up to my ankles or be as tall as the heels on my boots. Boy that is a thought….look Zal we’ve known each other a long time now you should be able to trust me that is unless you are scared of me?”  
Scared? Zal couldn’t bear for her to think he was scared , he was a man despite her size he had to show her that at least.  
“Tiffani stand back Im coming out”  
Tiffani stood up once more and edged back a few feet from the small craft. Looking at its hull she saw several shards of a bright internal light trying to escape around a four inch tall circular hatch and suddenly the hatch seemed to dissolve into thin air. Amazed Tiffani peered down as there seemed to be some steps made of nothing but coloured light forming from the base of the opening to the ground below. Her eyes widened as the silhouette of a tiny being emerged from the inside of the craft and there Zal stood as small if not smaller than he had offered. Very slowly he made his way down the steps one by one to the ground and Tiffani simply held her hand over her mouth as she gasped to see such a minute figure of a man. For Zal as he looked across at Tiffani he was suddenly very aware of her sheer size. Those towering black boots and her long legs travelled up into the sky for a considerable distance before the canopy of a tight denim skirt rose even higher still. Her midriff now gigantic was exposed offering a large area of her tanned stomach and her navel to his eyes but more impressive still was the way that her black crop top formed a huge overhang way above with the fullness of her womanly assets. She was gorgeous like no female he had ever seen before except her beauty was at a scale beyond his reach. They looked at each other for almost two minutes without so much as a word until Tiffani stepped forward to come closer to her tiny friend. Zal was a little taken back as once more he witnessed those enormous boots moving. He glimpsed the sole of the right boot seeing the pattern beneath it before it landed to his perspective only twenty or so feet away. The ground around his feet recognised her weight and transferred a small unsettling quiver to his feet but not enough to upset his balance. He stepped back onto the steps behind him a little afraid he had to admit.  
“Oh im sorry Zal please don’t be afraid its only me after all”  
“I, Im not afraid”  
He said unconvincingly  
“Do you mind if I kneel down its kind of a long way down to speak with you like this”  
“No err please”  
Zal watched the mountainous figure of Tiffani descend to her knees, knees that towered over him and now positioned themselves emerging from under the short skirt to form walls of flesh either side of where he stood as they almost nudged the side of his ship. Looking forward he was accidentally greeted to a long narrowing passage of her bare thighs under that skirt and he could just make out in the darkness some white panties that she was wearing. He wanted to look at that sight a lot longer but didn’t dare alert Tiffani to his gaze she was a giant after all and he didn’t wish to anger her.  
“Hi Zal”  
Tiffani spoke softly in her semi booming voice  
“Hi Tiffani”  
A large smile broke across her face as she saw how perfectly proportioned this tiny man was , he was still the very same handsome and muscular looking guy she had seen before only it was like an action figure had been cast of his body and brought to life.  
“You are so tiny now I know why you were nervous to step out and see me I must look like a huge monster”  
“I have never felt small until I laid eyes upon you Tiffani but you are no monster your more beautiful than I ever imagined. Beauty that is amplified by your incredible height”  
Tiffani almost blushed, Zal’s tendency to be honest was something she found hard to get used to but something she really liked.  
“You still think I am beautiful even though I’m bigger than your space ship?”  
“Without a doubt”  
Another big smile fell upon Tiffani’s face to his words he was the really the cutest little thing she had ever seen.  
“This is amazing im looking down at you and I feel like im a giant woman but I know it simply isn’t true , you are so teeny tiny is everyone from your planet this small?”  
“Tiffani I’ve travelled around the star systems and there are no females as large as you Earth females, perhaps this is why not many aliens have visited your planet its probably very dangerous, and it has to be why my father said to avoid Earth”  
“Well I guess I shouldn’t complain about feeling short eh?”  
Tiffani chuckled and saw her humour was lost on someone who was beyond the description of short.  
“Zal can I err ..pick you up in my hand?”  
Zal looked at the gargantuan beauty before him looming over him like a gravity crane at the space docks how would it feel to be lifted in such a way? And could he trust her? Of course it was Tiffani she wouldn’t harm him , regardless of meeting her face to face he felt he knew her very well. Dubiously he agreed and this seemed to please Tiffani as she lowered a humongous hand so it settled beside him.  
“There, I promise to be gentle just step onto my palm and Ill lift you up here so we can talk a bit better”  
Walking over to her hand he looked up the long slender but still giant arm that extended from it way up to her body above, how much power did she actually have? he wondered could she actually lift his ship if she wanted to? He mounted the soft skin of her palm and moved into the centre surrounded by her tall fingers as they towered over him, he noticed her long finger nails so clear and well manicured for a giant girl she had attractive hands but in their elegance he could also not deny that this very hand that now held him could equally crush him or dissect him like a bug with those nails he preyed his trust was well founded in Tiffani as he began to rise.  
“Hold on”  
Tiffani warned allowing Zal to move closer to her guarding fingers as they seemed to cradle him slightly as he rose higher and higher towards her face. From the palm of this mighty hand he could see her huge eyes. Big green piercingly bright eyes surrounded by the most thick and full eyelashes Zal had ever seen on a woman and now he was so close he almost felt the breeze from them as she blinked. For Tiffani he was just the perfect scaled down version of the guy she had grown so fond of and now there he was stood in the palm of her hand under her complete control.  
“wow your so perfect Zal , even your little muscles I can see them. Your hardly as tall as my little thumb”  
He looked at the huge thick digit and she was correct , what went through his mind was this thumb was stronger than all of his “little” muscles put together.  
“You are a goddess by stature Tiffani”  
“me a goddess”  
She laughed at the description  
“You know something though Zal your are adorable”  
“Is that good?”  
He said naively  
“It means I still like you a lot”  
She smiled and Zal couldn’t help feeling the look she gave him was like his little sister with her pet Zycron.  
“Tiffani , I suppose this ruins our plans for you to show me your world but that isn’t important for now I need to fix my craft and discover a source of Trelan to fashion some plating”  
“Hang on a minute Zal why should this spoil our plans?”  
“Incase you haven’t notice Tiffani im stood in your hand I couldn’t survive walking around this terrain it would only take one accidental footstep from a giant such as you and I would be flatter than a Carcalian slug”  
“Whatever one of those is?”  
She smiled and continued to study him with her eyes.  
“Im a little scared I might drop you Zal do you mind if I put you down for a minute?”  
“No problem I was feeling a little heady from being up here anyway”  
He answered which amused Tiffani as she lowered him but instead of placing him to the ground as he thought she would he found himself upon the taught surface of her denim skirt in the middle of her lap.  
“there you go little fella”  
Zal looked around, her skirt stretched out a long distance but her thighs even longer beyond to her knees. Admiring her legs he called up.  
”This must be a skirt im standing on?”  
“Yep what we call a mini skirt I bought it last week do you like it?”  
“Im not sure the term mini is relevant but yes it does accentuate your long legs I think the clothes you earth women wear are as amazing as I imagined”  
“doesn’t hurt to show a little leg now and then”  
Tiffani smiled down watching in wonder as Zal paced across her lap looking at her legs as she was still knelt.  
“and what was the garment under this skirt it seemed decorative is that your underwear you described”  
Tiffani blushed she hadn’t realised he’d seen her panties  
“Oh um that’s right, gosh I should learn to wear long skirts with little men around”  
“I prefer the short ones”  
Zal said genuinely in his over honest manor which again produced a half embarrassed but amused expression to her features.  
“thanks. Listen Zal what do you plan to do now I mean to get this ship of yours fixed Idd like to help you”  
Retrieving his portable sensor unit from his belt Zal scanned the exterior of his ship and looked at the read outs.  
“First of all I will have to initiate the nanobot repair units to address as much of the internal and external damage as possible , trouble is im going to have to leave the ship for 12 hours in order to let them scour the interior and use their plasmatic welders…..”  
Zal began leaving Tiffani half understanding his jargon  
“…..I should be able to camp out here in the vicinity of the ship whilst this is in effect and the next day I need to start searching for the Trelan deposits”  
“Hold on a minute little guy I don’t understand half of what you said but there is no way you can camp out here I mean look at you. Zal your tiny a little bird or god a wild fox infact anything could eat you”  
She shuddered at the thought  
“Its not safe for someone your size to camp out here I wont hear of it Zal tonight your coming home with me ok?”  
He turned around and looked up from her lap and was surprised at how immense her body looked stretching above him and looming sexily overhead. He could barely see her face now as her bosom jutted out in such a magnificent manor.  
“Tiffani , but you said your mother and father would disapprove?”  
“Well lets just say things aren’t such a big problem now , besides my dads away on business for a while and well mum doesn’t have to know im sure I can sneak you in”  
The offer was one that Zal was tempted with. He felt safe in the presence of Tiffani and was more than curious to see this world she existed in but part of him was hesitant due to his new found size in this world.  
“I don’t know what to say”  
“Just say yes and let me look after you alright?”  
She lowered a solitary finger tenderly to touch his face and gave him a confident and at the same time an inspiring look that said she wouldn’t allow anything to harm him.  
“With such a giant protector Im sure this could be an adventure”  
He smiled and then turned to look at the fall from the edge of her skirt to the ground below.  
“I will need some of my gear”  
Zal shouted and to Tiffani’s surprise he ran down the length of her skirt and bounced off the edge somersaulting to the ground below in an athletic and brave display. Tiffani was quite taken back at how agile her tiny friend was and thought it was also funny to see him perhaps trying to impress her. Disappearing inside his ship once more Zal grabbed some of his essential survival technology and inserted small devices into his clothing. Taking one last look at the interior of his ship he commanded.  
“computer activate nano repair bots cycle for 12 hours duration , contact me on the com-line with the results”  
“Nano repair will commence in ten minutes”  
Zal walked towards the exit hatch catching sight of one huge knee several feet from the opening he questioned if he was doing the right thing to brave this world and trust in this goddess when suddenly at that moment of doubt an enormous mass of giant jiggling breasts contained in a tight black top came lowering into view just teasing a flash of cleavage that was way taller than Zal and next a mass of long blonde hair and those sparkling green diamonds Tiffani called her eyes. She was peering into the craft to see if he was coming. His hesitation subsided in milliseconds and he walked out of the ship and down the steps.  
  
##Part 5  

“Wow I wish I could have seen inside your ship Zal that would have been so cool”  
He looked up at her and then back at the spaceship which was dwarfed by her sheer size.  
“I wish it was big enough Tiffani its not very impressive eh?”  
“It is kinda cute like some big toy”  
Cute? Zal had to laugh at her description.  
“So big lady lets go!”  
Zal began to traverse the awkward terrain making his way up a steep slope until he was confronted by a wall which he had to make his way around. Meantime Tiffani just stared down in wonder as she saw him struggling to walk up what had to be a small bump in the ground and how he had to walk around a clump of house bricks rather than just step over them. He had been moving past obstruction upon obstruction , sometimes climbing other times jumping across gaps in the ground for two or three minutes convinced he was making good progress when he heard a stifled laugh booming from behind.  
”that looks like hard work! All that effort and you’ve probably traveled mmm let me see a good three feet”  
Looking back he saw his giant friend now stood some way back biting her lip not to laugh at him any more.  
“this is treacherous terrain”  
He shouted back in all seriousness.  
“are you coming?”  
Barely hearing his tiny call Tiffani took a few long strides and her black boots came thudding down beside Zal in seconds.  
”phew that was tiring”  
She pretended to catch her breathe  
“very funny”  
Zal looked up at her enormous boots now a few feet away to him and was suddenly recognizing how ridiculous he must have looked to her. What was a mere couple of steps over rubble for her was an obstacle course of giant barriers and pit falls for him.  
“Look Zal no disrespect but I would like to get home before sunrise if its all the same to you so how about if you allow me to carry you to my home?”  
He looked up at her inviting smile and wondered how it would feel to actually be carried he was an adult after all and used to moving about freely on his own but she did have a point, what was a minor walk for her was several marathons for him.  
“Just promise not to drop me ok?”  
Smiling up he felt like he was three years old waiting to be picked up by his mother only no one had a mother so enormous as the woman towering over him right now.  
“Good”  
Tiffani was secretly delighted she had enjoyed handling him earlier and the feeling it gave her to be responsible for this small delicate and very handsome being. Bending down with her arm stretched out she opened her fingers wide and clasped them around his entire body closing them gently on him as she lifted him up.  
With Zal out of sight in her hand consumed by its size she thought for a second where was she going to carry him? If he fell from her hand he could die or be injured from the fall she remembered he said that she looked 200 feet tall so falling from her hand would be death at over a hundred feet in the air. She reached into her left skirt pocket at the front and pulled out a lipstick and a some keys. Transferring them to her other pocket to join some loose change she smiled to herself at the thought of what she was about to do. She unclasped her hand around Zal and saw him lying there in her palm once more as she stood up straight.  
“Hope you don’t mind little guy but im putting you in my skirt pocket for safe keeping ok?”  
She didn’t really provide him with an opportunity to say no and soon Zal was dropped deep into the confines of her pocket as she retracted her hand and could barely feel his weight , infact her lipstick and keys had made more of an impact. Smoothing the front of her skirt gently she walked on with a grin towards home tempted to check with her fingers now and then inside that very pocket but refraining from doing so. For Zal the experience was new and quite disorienting, he couldn’t get over that he was so small that his friend had simply placed him in her skirt pocket and there he would remain in the darkness until she reached her home. It was a warm environment and a little tight as the denim seemed snug to her thighs behind the material. Her grand movements jostled him gently around and he looked forward to when she would take him out so he could see where she lived. It was only less than ten minutes before Tiffani and her secret guest arrived home , greeting her mother swiftly in the living room she past through.  
“Im off to bed mum”  
“So early it only eight o’clock?”  
Came the response  
“Yeh, college in the morning Ive got some revising to do”  
“Ok honey , goodnight”  
Zal rocked violently with her legs as Tiffani ascended the staircase and then things settled as she entered her bedroom.  
“Zal are you ok?”  
Tiffani questioned as she retrieved her small passenger from the confines of her mini skirt pocket.  
“Im fine it was a little bumpy and dark but im ok”  
He looked from her hand that now held him and could see a vast room. It was colourful filled with objects of a huge size to him and all of them looking like large antiques because he came from such an advanced civilization.  
“Welcome to my bedroom Zal”  
“This is where you sleep?”  
“Sure is”  
Placing him down upon her pine bedside cabinet Zal looked around in amusement.  
“Your home is like a timewarp I haven’t seen furnishings made of natural substances except in museums, and your doors over there do you really turn the handle and push them open manually?”  
Tiffani grinned.  
“Guess im from the dark ages to you eh?”  
“Its not unlike Tallion perhaps two or three hundred years ago…..”  
He turned and looked up at the gorgeous vision that was Tiffani as she stood there towering over him with so much flesh on display offered by her tight but revealing outfit. Taking a lingering look he continued.  
“….except you have such wonderful clothing here”  
Tiffani twirled to show off a little and smiled proudly.  
“it must be pretty boring with all your women wearing the same thing except different colours , on Earth we like to be a little more individual”  
“Im beginning to like certain parts of Earth a lot”  
Zal grinned and produced a small blush to her cheeks from the look he gave her.  
“Have you eaten Zal?”  
“I had a ration supplement several hours ago Im good for a few days”  
“a few days? Don’t you space guys eat like us regular human beings?”  
“Of course, but when we go into deep space we have our food concentrated and take it in tablet form  
When we digest the tablet it breaks down in our bodies gradually and releases the nutrients to fulfill and sustain us for several days its pretty normal , and Tiffani your anything but a regular human being I’d say your exceptional and gorgeous”  
Tiffani took in his compliment and now she was blushing with full force this tiny handsome visitor from outer space was so articulate compared to the boys she socialized with hiding none of his feelings.  
“Thanks Zal, and you’re the cutest little alien I’ve have ever met”  
Zal didn’t much care for the term cutest but decided to let it pass as he must have looked like a cute little toy to someone the size of this giant girl before him.  
“So if your not hungry then I guess we can listen to some music ok with you?”  
“Music?”  
“You know a CD?”  
His face was blank  
“Is it an instructional audio file?”  
“Zal your kidding right? I mean you don’t have Music on Tallion?”  
Tiffani proceeded to insert a CD into her small portable boom box , she lifted it off a shelf and stood it down next to Zal on the cabinet and he gazed up at the house sized object to him in wonder.  
“Oh you mean recreational audio , that’s music. We don’t have music on Tallion but Ive heard it at Space ports before from other races and like I said before I enjoy to dance when I get the opportunity”  
“that’s great I’d like to see your moves, but first the music”  
A flick of her finger upon the controls and the CD player jumped into life half scaring Zal with its sounds as he seemed almost pushed back by it and onto his backside.  
“oops”  
Tiffani giggled as he stood up holding his ears trying to block out the overpowering thud of the fast dance track that was blearing out. Seeing him cowering in discomfort she quickly adjusted the volume to a softer lower setting although in reality it wasn’t that loud. He began to appreciate the beat and decided this unusual music was something he rather enjoyed and as he found the edge of a book to sit upon he tapped his feet watching his giant friend begin to move to the music which was a very distracting sight. Tiffani was light on her feet an able dancer and she kicked off the boots to enable her more flexibility to perform. She was swaying her curvy hips and moving very fluidly which was an enchanting performance for Zal as his eyes were drawn to the animation of her huge breasts beneath her tight top as it shifted side to side and up and down with their sheer weight. He was lost in his stare which had turned from one of interest to one of desire and lust as this giantess proceeded to swing her body this way and that almost provocatively in her gestures. Seeing the lavished attention her body was drawing Tiffani secretly smiled to her self having captivated her audience so well she hadn’t turned on any moves for his benefit and yet his eyes seemed targeted upon her body tracking her every gyration.  
Realizing her tiny admirer was spell bound with her movements she began to play on this and moved closer to her cabinet filling his view with her towering thighs and looming above him as she shifted to push her pert rear end out and lowered it in a swift wiggle. Zal saw the tremendous curve of her firm rear that was so well defined in that tight skirt and as it rapidly moved high in the air above him he longed to be the size of a man who could take his hands to those curves she had and feel that swaying skirt from behind cupped in his own palms. It was at this moment Zal felt the early signs of the burning this giantess was bringing on his arousal and with all Tallion males it would have to be satisfied or else he would suffer. Tiffani still loving the effect she seemed to have spun around and with her hands held high in a dance move over her head she thrust her jutting bosoms out and forward filling her top to capacity as she performed a slinky move to lower down twisting her knees bringing her ample charms that much closer to the cabinet below. Zal was overwhelmed as he saw her chest increase in its size considerably with both her shoulders pushing back and the effect of gravity filling them as they jiggled perhaps twenty of his feet above , close enough that he was in no doubt of their gigantic outline and they were big enough that he was briefly in their shifting shadow as she eclipsed the bedroom light for a few seconds. His flight suit now began to fill out down his right leg with his appreciation as his manhood swelled. The music track was short lived and as it faded Tiffani rose up to her building like size and gently rocked side to side as the next track a slow ballard kicked in. Smiling she lowered to the side on her knees so all Zal could see was her face and chin resting on the wooden surface.  
“Care to dance Zal?”  
He looked across confused  
“Um with your ankles? Im not sure its wise for me to be below someone of your impressive stature Tiffani”  
This produced an amused look to her face  
“That’s not what I meant , here why don’t you dance with my fingers?”  
Her large hand came over the surface and positioned itself upon her long finger nails , several of her fingers retreated curling back leaving the two longest to confront Zal. He was in a bit of discomfort with his rising member trapped in his flight suit but he stood up and took the idea she presented in his stride. Walking up to her long slender digits he saw how they towered over him mainly due to her long clear finger nails. He rested his left hand aside one of the upper joints of the right finger and began to dance slowly with them as they followed his lead. Tiffani looked down in wonder as he gracefully moved his muscular frame accepting her fingers as big as they were as his dancing partner. The feeling of his little hands upon her skin and the odd nudge of his body was intriguing to her it felt good almost sexual. Her eyes drifted to his backside and she gently bit her lip a little in frustration at how small this man was because he seemed so perfect.  
“Hey Zal you can pretend my fingers here are you dancing with me and they are my long legs”  
He felt the breathy comments of Tiffani from the side as he found himself having fun with his unique dancing partner, thinking of her imaginative suggestion that these were a pair of ladies legs before him he found the dance that much more stimulating which wasn’t a good thing in his present condition making his movements much slower to compensate for the added growth under his flight suit.  
“If these are your legs then you are still a very tall lady indeed”  
He took a brief look at the huge face and those wonderful green eyes following his every step.  
  
##Part 6  
  
At that point unwittingly Tiffani moved one of her fingers out a little in a more exaggerated step forward and the lower half found its way between his legs just brushing his excitement and he instantly wondered if she felt its presence through the hi-tech material which she did producing a broad smile to her face as she wondered if that tiny lump she sensed was indeed his member. As the music faded and tailed off Zal moved to her fingers and in turn pressed his lips to kiss them in a friendly manor of thanks. The light touch of his lips and the almost imperceptible moistness of them was a delight to Tiffani it felt very good and it made her wonder how those little kisses would feel upon other places.  
“Thank you for the dance my lady”  
He offered gallantly as he parted company with her fingers to go and sit down once more.  
“Does the lady get to kiss you back?”  
She questioned but before Zal had chance to answer her fingers clasped his whole body in mid stride and cupping around him they gently lifted him towards her face. As Zal was held there half consumed by the curved fist around him he suddenly found himself presented before her pretty features outlined by the long blonde hair that cascaded aside her face. Her button type nose was huge as was everything else. Big green eyes larger than the astro globes Zal would kick around just for fun , huge thick eyelashes that captured the wind with their every flutter and closest of all to him were two enormous thick and plump lips covered in a layer of almost metallic or pearlesant effect pink lip stick that made them seem even more defined and prominent. These lips framed the outline of a gleaming white toothy smile as he was taken towards them and next they slowly met each other as she formed a more exaggerated pout in order to extend those lips forward and to his face. In a blissful moment Zal’s whole face and upper body collided with the softness of those pillow like lips as they covered his forehead , nose ,chin and neck in a long and moist smack of a kiss. He had never felt anything like it. A consuming kiss that tingled in its embrace of his flesh and the fantastic smell of her lipstick as it smudged its impression upon him. Her hand released him to the wooden surface once more and he was breathless for a second or two as he looked at her seeing once more those huge lips that now expressed her equal pleasure to be in contact with him as they beamed a smile. He reached up his hands to feel his now sticky face and neck seeing the pink residue that came off on his finger tips to the touch.  
“wow”  
He almost breathed silently but his comment was heard by the giantesses mighty ears beneath the long blonde hair that sat over them.  
“That was different”  
Tiffani said in obvious approval of their contact and she moved back slightly in order to see Zals expression more clearly. It was then she noticed his pink face and the top of his flight suit and shoulders covered in a radiant pink glow.  
“Oops , sorry Zal guess I got a little carried away”  
“No need to be sorry that was amazing”  
He gulped reveling in the moment and simply had to sit down now as his manhood was more than uncomfortable. Tiffani simply replied  
“It was…it really , really was…”  
Her words repeated themselves as if to convince herself that yes she really did like feeling such a small man pressed to her lips as it was unlike any kiss she had ever had. A little embarrassed she quickly got practical and stood up to fetch something from a drawer by her study desk in the corner. Once more lowering on her knees to put her head at his level she handed a damp cloth the size of a towel to Zal. He took the very wet lemon smelling material, it was a left over finger wipe from the Kentucky take away meal she had enjoyed in her room the night before but to her tiny friend it was a enough to remove the residue from his clothes and freshen up his face.  
“Thanks”  
He smiled and dropped the wipe to one side. The CD had stopped and they both just looked at each other not sure what to say for a couple of minutes. This silence filled with their growing curiosity of what had just occurred. Zal was becoming more aware of his arousal and knew he needed privacy for his release soon.  
“Um Zal I guess we had better figure out where you are gonna sleep eh?”  
“Yes that would be a good idea, where do you sleep in that structure beside this building im stood on?”  
”Building?”  
Tiffani was amused at his description of her bedside cabinet  
“yes , that’s my bed up there but what can I do to make you a bed?”  
She wandered around her bedroom looking for inspiration he was so small , small enough to fit anywhere she thought but nothing jumped to her attention.  
“Tiff are you still up?”  
A voice came from beyond the bedroom door and suddenly her mother entered. Unprepared for this event Tiffani now the opposite side of her room was startled and then froze alarmed that her mother might see Zal down on the cabinet. Zal was fast to react and almost leapt behind the huge cd player and but peeked inquisitively to see the visitor. Tiffani’s mother was much taller than her daughter which struck Zal in an instant as he peered around from behind the huge electric device to see her longer legs wandering past. She was just as beautiful but it was clear she was much older as her make up was applied skillfully to minimize the very slight tell tale signs of her 36 years of age. Her figure was as curvy as her daughters except for her chest which although very large and ample didn’t jut out as defiantly behind the simple blue summer dress that she wore but she was in summary quite breathtaking to Zal.  
“Mum err what’s up?”  
“You’re a bit jumpy aren’t you? Have I caught you in the middle of something darling?”  
“No I was just a bit surprised , don’t know why”  
Her voice was unconvincing as her eyes cast across the room to see Zal out of sight with relief.  
“Sorry mum, I don’t know what came over me just being a bit silly”  
“Yeh sure Tiff, Look I came up to discuss the other night”  
“The other night?”  
“Tiff I heard you speaking well a little bit openly to a boy on the phone in your room”  
“Mum that’s my business you shouldn’t be listening”  
“Sorry but I was about to knock on your door I didn’t mean to eavesdrop but there’s two things Tiff.. One you haven’t told me who this new man in your life is and number two I hope your not running up a huge mobile phone bill , your father and I don’t support you in college for you to chat up boys on your cell phone all evening costing us more money”  
Tiffani realized this was one of her conversations with Zal on the com-crystal.  
“Mum look no worries it was his bill ok he calls me”  
“aah so there is a man then? I thought you’ve been keeping something secret for some time now so are you going to share the details with your mum or what?”  
Her mother smiled her eyes searching her daughters face for a reaction.  
“well not much to tell mum , he’s a little older than me and extremely good looking…”  
She found herself beginning to describe Zal  
“a firm athletic body , tight little bum , you know just my type”  
“So what’s this hunks name then?”  
“Zal”  
“That’s an odd name where does he come from?”  
“Um oh quite far away he’s foreign”  
“Ooh with a nice accent I hope. So what does he do this new man of yours?”  
”Oh he’s into haulage , yes he transports things that’s why he isn’t around a lot”  
”Long distance relationship eh? So do you really like him I mean is it serious?”  
”I really do like him a lot its like we’ve known each other forever”  
Zal followed the conversation with great interest looking up at the back of Tiffani’s mother as she stood several real feet before where he hid.  
“That’s great Im happy for you and does he feel the same?”  
“Im not sure. I , well …I think he likes me the way he looks up at me sometimes…”  
“Looks up at you?”  
Tiffani realized what she had said  
“Oh yeh he’s well kinda vertically challenged , well short you know im pretty tall compared to him the tallest girlfriend he’s ever been out with infact”  
“ A short guy eh? There’s nothing wrong with that its quite nice actually to feel tall yourself for a change I mean your fathers 5ft 11 inches tall and when I wear some of my higher heels Im actually a little taller than him on occasions, besides it gives you a little more confidence believe me”  
Her mother looked casually around the room as Zal took cover to avoid detection and she started to make for the door  
“So when do I get to meet this short hunk then?”  
“Well he’s often traveling mum you know perhaps next time he’s in town eh?”  
“mm ok, night sweetheart”  
“night mum”  
The door closed and Tiffani rushed over to Zal and sat on the bed beside the cabinet. Zal came walking back out and could see the partial length of one thigh protruding from her short skirt not far away pressing against the side of the woodwork as it then dropped beyond his view into a pair of long slender legs.  
“That was close , mum nearly saw you”  
”I react pretty fast I used to dodge crimson flyers back home in the forests ..but then you wouldn’t know one if it hit you..”  
He grinned  
“Your mums very pretty Tiffani I see where you get your looks from”  
“Yeh, she’s young for a mum more like a big sister to me sometimes, look Zal im sorry for talking about you and saying you’re my boyfriend and all…”  
Zal interrupted  
“im not sorry in the slightest , so what? I am your friend aren’t I?”  
”well yes but boyfriend means a lot more than just a friend it means we are well seeing each other and well you know very close and that “  
”like lovers?”  
He smiled and saw for the second time her face colour with a pink glow  
“yes”  
“So do you have a boyfriend Tiffani? Am I your boyfriend?”  
His blunt question made her stop and think , he was so direct at times again unlike any of the boys she knew and who had she been out with in the last few years. The answer was no one of real consequence her longest relationship of worth in the last three years ended after 4 months and mainly due to him being jealous and thinking she had someone else. That someone else had always been Zal the person she confided in and spoke to night after night , the man who dominated her dreams and the man who no other to match the personality of and from what she could see today the looks of.  
“no I don’t have a boyfriend. So let me ask you , would you like me to be your girlfriend Zal? Your giant alien girlfriend?”  
Her tone was sweet and open as she smiled down at him expectantly  
“Id like that very much Tiffani”  
Zal managed to lean a little off the edge of the surface and kissed the bare side of her outer thigh tenderly.  
“You are so different Zal , I’ve never met a guy like you”  
“One so small?”  
“Well I suppose that’s true most of my dates have been taller than my little finger but no that’s not what I meant. You just seem to say what you think most of the time and that’s rare on this planet…and I like that”  
“You make me wish I was two hundred feet tall Tiffani I could sweep you off your feet and carry you away in my spaceship.”  
“You mean your not planning to sweep me off my feet now?”  
She grinned playfully  
“I suppose then its down to me to sweep you off your feet then tiny”  
A huge hand clasped around Zals body and lifted him with ease before her face it was at that point she noticed close up the evident bulge in his flight suit. Was she having this effect on him she wondered? Of course it had to be her but yet she hadn’t done anything of worth to produce such a reaction which made her feel quite confident as it seemed Zal didn’t obviously mind the immense size difference between them and holding him like this being in total control of a man in her hand filled her with sensations she enjoyed very much. Should she tease him just a little? She wondered to herself and then produced a wide smile as she took him closer to her lips again. Zal was surprised to be lifted so close once more but liked immensely the feeling of her strong fingers as they held him firmly but gently and the view he couldn’t complain about as those lips of hers captivated him and he longed to feel them pressed once more to his flesh.  
“So Zal as your not two hundred feet tall like your big girlfriend here so I get to call the shots for a change in a relationship”  
“I don’t think im in any position to argue with that”  
“mmm I don’t think you are either infact I could do just about anything I wanted with a little boyfriend like you”  
Bringing him close to her luscious lips his head under nose, he was almost touching them and felt her breathe whistle around his face as she whispered  
“anything I wanted because your so tiny compared to me”  
She felt empowered and quite turned on as she pulled him back gently to cast her big green eyes on him once more seeing his expression of wonder.  
“How did you describe me earlier, oh yes, a giantess? So don’t worry my little boyfriend I will be a gentle giantess”  
  
##Part 7  
  
She placed him down onto the surface of her bed sheet and stood up disappointing Zal who somehow hoped for more. To him her bed was vast a mammoth platform that stretched endlessly away with its pink and white checkered pattern , he walked along it watching the backside of Tiffani as she made for the door a distance that looked like a good ten minutes trek to Zals perspective. He diverted his eyes away from the giantess to once more explore the bed and found himself even smaller than some of the creases that had formed in its surface from where Tiffani once sat. There was a dull clicking sound and he looked up to see her returning having locked the door.  
”That’s better a girl needs her privacy when she’s got company”  
Walking slowly back Zal could see a smile he didn’t recognize , it wasn’t an evil smile more of a mischievous one. She walked close to the edge of the bed and leaned down her knees slightly bent with her hands cupping them as she loomed over him. His appreciation of her fabulous and very generous curves quadrupled as once more gravity saw to the weight of her busty swell and they dangled in her tight top filling it out to stressing point. Her tall and exceptionally deep cleavage line was very predominant and extended by her leaning posture and Zal feasted his eyes on the sheer size of her endowments.  
“Your body is truly magnificent”  
He said with his eyes firmly and unashamedly routed to her top and slowly raising them up that slender neck to catch hers. Zal instantly knew that she had caught the direction of his previous gaze but she didn’t mind infact this was just the attention she had planned.  
“are all girls on this planet as blessed as you?”  
“Blessed? Oh you mean these?”  
Tiffani glanced at her bust and formed a proud smile letting it sway just a little bit for effect.  
“Actually Zal until a about four or so months ago I was just a touch more than average, these were just about filling a D cup but then almost magically they grew into a Double D cup and now Im probably an E cup although my mum refuses to keep buying me new bras until I stabilize a little. Which reminds me tiny you have a thing for boobs don’t you? Especially big boobs….”  
Zal’s member was filled to capacity now he couldn’t believe this giant beauty was discussing her breasts with him.  
“I love the female form but breasts especially large breasts are my weakness”  
Tiffani lowered down closer to him feeling very confident now, she kneeled before the bed and her chest hovered only a few inches above the top cover and only six real inches away from her tiny boyfriend.  
”Well there’s one major plus in being so tiny and small like you Zal. Every girl you encounter on this planet will have a pair of big boobs. Actually that’s an understatement every Earth girl will have massive giant pair of boobs that are much bigger than you are , even if they sport a little A or B cup your not going to measure up to them and talking of measuring up….”  
Tiffani paused in her sentence and seductively used her thumb and forefinger to gauge the size of Zal by closing the distance between the digits. She then moved that size close to her impressive cleavage line with a huge smile at the result before she continued.  
“…. it must be a bit intimidating when your girlfriend here has a pair as enormous as these and more than a bit sexy to compare yourself against am I right?”  
Now Zal was aware very aware of the scale of Tiffani’s breasts as they stood like small hills before him each of them making him feel tiny and weak. How he longed to reach out and caress such gorgeous full heaving breasts yet given all of this strength he wouldn’t even be able to take the tremendous weight of one with his entire body.  
“Tiffani they tower over me they are just the most impressive breasts I have ever encountered and so gigantic I feel so small like I should be worshipping them.”  
“You are funny Zal , although it might be nice to have a little boyfriend worship my big breasts”  
She gave a wide smile with another more seductive look as she touched down her chest on the bed which just made the vista for Zal even more impressive as they swelled up and out to an even more intimidating size.  
“Don’t be scared Zal come closer they won’t hurt you”  
Looking up for a nod of approval he walked cautiously towards her top. Soon he was so close that her giant beautiful face was beyond his eyes and the curved wall of her bosoms just dominated his vision.  
“You can touch them if you want Zal test if they are really this big”  
Without a second offer his hands reached out and up and slid over the exterior of her tight top. He could sense the warmth of her flesh beneath and could just form the tiniest of dents to the smooth outline if he pushed in with his palms. His eyes search for her nipple but it was higher than he could reach and formed its impression into the material offering that it was extraordinarily large at least to Zal. As he enjoyed hugging his tiny frame and pressing against the outside of her black top he felt the texture of another layer within, something between her naked breasts and the top.  
“mmm, that feels good , you’ve got such a delicate touch with those little hands of yours”  
“This is so monumental!”  
He exclaimed joyfully and was totally absorbed now as he pressed his body to her top and felt the sensation of his manhood rubbing against the inside of his flight suit begging no screaming for release.  
“Maybe you would like to see my bra underneath Zal, I did promise you that didn’t I?”  
Tiffani was over any initial reservations she had and felt quite turned on by the fact that this great looking guy was completely hers and despite her original disappointment that he was so small she was beginning to find his size quite stimulating feeling increasingly more confident to continue her teasing and flirting.  
“I would like that”  
Zal was entranced by her movements he stepped back to see a broad smile on her perfect features as Tiffani slowly removed her tight top over her head and her huge white bra delicately detailed with lacy swirling patterns and shapes bounced into a spectacular display as the true enormity of her breasts could be seen. Casting off her top she looked over her pronounced bust and down at Zal who was consumed by his lustful thoughts and so obviously stunned by the dominating presence of her sizeable attributes.  
“Now this is a woman’s bra Zal”  
She began speaking in an increasingly seductive tone as she let her hands drift around her bra cups and gently caress the fullness of her form within. Allowing her hands to drop away she lowered her chest once more closer to Zal this time tilting it so that the entirety of the long deep channel of cleavage was facing him.  
“I err, oh my…”  
He was lost for words as he appreciated how incredibly sexy this giant beautiful blonde was and now almost like a dream he was seeing her breasts in a garment unlike any he had witnessed that simply presented these giant female forms so dramatically ensuring that the full extent of her cleavage was present and so well formed.  
“You see Zal , bra’s can be very sexy. First they hold my boobs nice and firm making them push out as much as possible beneath my clothes to attract attention and then secondly they bring large boobs like mine closer together to create cleavage and for guys the bigger the cleavage the sexier my boobs appear and I think this bra does such a great job don’t you Zal?”  
Standing before her cleavage line he saw how it easy towered over him and more amazing than this he could see just how deep those humongous breasts this bra had captured were.  
“ooo, our women wear nothing like this its breathtaking”  
He stammered as he touched the soft smooth exterior of her bra running his tiny hands along the swirling lacy lines and looking at the contrast of her tanned flesh exposed between the gaps in the pattern.  
“more than that Zal, bra’s are exciting for men because they give them a good idea of how big we are and every guy on Earth longs to take off our bra’s just so they can see what naked delights we have underneath, so how about it Zal care to do the honors?”  
”mission accepted”  
Zal looked at the formidable size of her bra and the long taught straps way over his head that fastened it to her shoulders. He dug his fingers into the lace exterior and pulled down but did little to even make an impression.  
“not like that silly its fastened at the back, now this is a test of the real skill of a man to remove a bra”  
“a challenge I willingly accept”  
Zal grinned for ear to ear watching her turn her back to the bedside but as she did so her long blonde hair swept into him covering him with its soft silky and fragrant mass. He was knocked to his knees and as he stood he found himself in this delicate jungle.  
“oops sorry Zal I didn’t think , guess im still adjusting to being with someone so small”  
Her hands lifted her hair up and now Zal saw her tanned back and shoulder blades with the contrasting thick white band that secured her bra, a band as tall as he was. She lowered enough that he could reach its top on tip toes but for Zal this simple hook and eye catch was beyond his strength to even budge the smallest of fractions.  
“aaahhh!”  
He grimaced and through himself to the task desperate to have the true glory of her breasts discovered. But the catch remained firm he felt weak and defeated by a simple piece of her giant clothing.  
“whats wrong Zal? Its only a little bra catch , don’t you want to see all of me?”  
Tiffani grinned as she teased knowing fore well what a task this must be for him and it served to provide her with the terrific difference between their strengths as this tiny man determined to remove her bra didn’t posses even half the strength found in her own little fingers.  
“I wont give in!”  
He bravely stated knowing his efforts were futile but then suddenly her bra fell slack and loose as the back band lost all its previous tension. Surprised Tiffani looked at the loose dangling elastic material beneath one armpit and saw instantly her ingenious little boyfriend had help from technology.  
“You cut my bra band?”  
She said half amused and half feeling like she deserved her bra to be broken for teasing him.  
Turning around Zal was looking down at his thigh as he replaced the laser cutter into its holster with his pride fully restored. When he looked back up there was this beautiful giantess slipping the straps from her shoulders yet holding the suspense of the view by keeping the loose cups in place.  
“now that was naughty little man , this was one of my prettiest and most favourite bra’s, I may have to make you wear it now as a punishment”  
Giggling she dropped the bra down upon him and covered Zal completely with one enormous cup.  
“Doesn’t look like it fits you as well as me though and I don’t think you will grow into it”  
She continued to giggle as she watched the comical efforts of this tiny man trying to escape from her bra, he pushed up at the material and began to make progress when a huge set of fingers and a hand surrounded him , capturing him in the bra. He lost his orientation as Tiffani turned him upside down and released him so that he was suspended in her bra cup before her eyes.  
“looks like Ive caught a little space man trying to get into my big bra”  
“Hey no fair”  
Zal protested amused but also appreciating how much at this giantesses mercy he was.  
“You are so tiny Zal you look so little and lost inside my big bra cup down there”  
Zal remained still sunk deep into the white mass of material around him looking far up and over the circular edges above at the sexy green eyes studying him. His hands rubbed against the walls of this soft prison and he commented upon the sensations.  
“its very soft in here and smells wonderful just like you do. Tiffani I like your bra very much”  
Recovering to his knees deep within the white lacy cage that held him so completely, he waited for her to reply.  
“Well mister as this bra is no good to me now I think we solved where you can sleep tonight eh tiny? My big ole bra will make a deluxe bed for a little boyfriend”  
With her huge eyes gleaming their green sparkle upon him she noticed once more that he was extremely aroused.  
“Zal are you just enjoying being in my giant sexy bra or is the thought of how well I fill that giant material that’s turning you on so much?”  
Her teasing words didn’t require an answer but as honest as ever his reply called up.  
“Tiffani this is such a sensual garment one that is so huge that it overwhelms me with its softness and as I hang here trapped inside its depth I know that only a beautiful goddess like you would be able to offer a body with such gigantic and beautiful proportions to fill this decorative material”  
Tiffani blushed his words had a habit of getting to her now and again.  
“Goddess, im not so sure but definitely to you I am a giantess with giant sized boobs”  
Zal found his view altering suddenly her neck rose and climbed higher and then as she held apart the huge white cup with him forced into its centre her breast began to fill the sky and became all he could see. Her nipple was much larger than he would have expected and much wider than his own head and the detail of her the darker skin that formed the base of her nipple was such a wondrous sight for him to behold , never before had he appreciated the intricate lines and small bumps that graced a womans areola but then never before had he been so small to a woman as he was to this colossal breast.  
  
##Part 8  
  
“Tiffani its incredible! You are indeed a goddess!”  
He cried out bringing a smile to her face as she wondered quite what his perspective must be faced with her huge breast bearing down upon him , she could not even see him now below it and she wondered how far she should go with her teasing.  
“How would like to me to put this bra back on little Zal with you still inside it? Actually don’t answer because I know you’ll enjoy this as much as I will and im going to do it anyway”  
In seconds he wasn’t sure if she lowered her breast to the cup or if he was raised higher in the bra to embrace her bare breast but there he was pressed deep against her forgiving flesh as it plastered his face and body to its bountiful curve. He wriggled happily with his back against the soft net like structure of her bra supporting him and made it to her nipple. Throwing his arms around it he felt its enormity it was larger by itself than any single breast he had felt before and he found himself kissing and caressing its sides and top.  
“Oh wow , oh Zal”  
Tiffani said somehow surprised at the feelings his small attentions had generated she was enjoying it a lot. But before he could get too carried away he was captured in her bra once more as the giantess moved him. The next thing Zal knew he was stood in the centre of her bra cup as its edges fell down and surrounded him as if he was in a large white bowl as big as the ionic spa pool in back on his planet.  
Where was he? He looked about unable to see much over the rise of the bra material walls until he trampled them down and discovered the bra had been draped over Tiffani’s stomach and she was now laid down on the bed waiting for him to explore her bodyscape.  
“Why don’t you come up here Zal and try that again with my boobs?”  
She called in a loud enticing voice and he stepped onto her taught stomach feeling it give slightly to each of his small steps. In the distance before him lay her cleavage, now a large expanse with those towering bare breasts forming a valley that he could walk between.  
“If only I was taller”  
He muttered but the large ears of his girlfriend caught his words  
“Zal you’re the perfect size, small enough for me to smuggle into to my room as my secret boyfriend and just look at me , you wanted a girlfriend with big breasts and now you’ve got just that and so much more, You are just the right size to climb these big sexy hill sized boobs of mine”  
Her words spurred him on encouraging him that she was enjoying their first encounter. He walked up to her left breast and like admiring a large sculpture he walked around its base running a hand high above his head to feel its warm exterior. Then he walked between the massive breasts as she teased.  
“better hurry up tiny you might get squished in there”  
He smiled and found his way to the base of her neck and looked down at the slope of her boobs. He dashed valiantly to the right one and tried to defy its tall curve to scale it but he came crashing down on the soft surface below.  
“not too big for you are they Zal?”  
She whispered knowing he was close to her face. But in an amazing athletic vault he ran again flipping onto his hands and projecting himself upwards managing to reach out and clasp her breast way above. It was a great move and enjoyed by Tiffani who was impressed with his abilities. He climbed up and proudly stood with his elbow resting on her now enlarged nipple.  
“I have conquered the giantess”  
He began  
”Not yet you haven’t tiny, you have to pleasure the giantess first before she is truly yours”  
Zal suddenly felt less brave she was teasing him but yet she also seemed to desire more from him and he didn’t know if he was capable of loving a woman so vast. Eager to try he sat with his legs straddling her giant nipple as he nuzzled and kissed its tip and caressed its length by embracing it with his arms. He could feel it grow just a little to his touch and the heat from her breast flesh below began rising enough that he could feel it through his suit.  
“that’s nice Zal my nipples have always been very sensitive and oooh that’s really hitting the spot”  
In the distance he saw her eyes close as she reveled in his actions but he could see she needed more if he was to bring her to climax. He stopped and slid down off her boob which was a considerable drop below.  
“hey I was enjoying that tiny”  
“Tiffani can I make love to you?”  
He looked up in an almost innocent way  
“Zal err incase these humongous breasts of mine towering beside you and this two hundred foot body of mine your stood on isn’t enough of a clue I don’t think your equipment how ever large is going to do much for a girl my size Zal infact your whole body is smaller than any guys tackle that Ive ever seen no disrespect…”  
She offered a look to say she wasn’t trying to hurt his feeling but Tiffani knew she had something a lot bigger than Zal was between her legs.  
“I am so small aren’t I? you must think im nothing to you”  
“actually I was thinking how nice you made me feel when you were on top of my boob and how Idd like some more of that”  
Zal looked behind and down the long stretch of her body to the skirt band way below and the hint of her underwear beneath it, his mind imagined the journey below.  
“It must be very intimidating for you Zal I couldn’t even imagine if our roles were reversed how it would make me feel to see your giant prick taller than I was knowing there was no way for me to take it and your probably just realising how small your two inches of height is compared to my parts. God it would be like a cave to someone as little as you , Zal you could probably get lost inside me”  
She felt rather hot as she began to think of the comparison, the thought of a man that could enter her so completely but she knew that was impossible or was it? The sheer thought of these new possibilities began to make her wet , very wet  
“Here Zal let me lift you back up on top of my boob so you can continue the good work and Ill take care of down here today but maybe we can re-explore how brave you may feel about it tomorrow besides you’ve only been my boyfriend for the last hour”  
Zal found himself on the summit of her breast again assuming the same position as he saw Tiffani’s hand reach under the waist band of her skirt and disappear beneath. He began to raise her arousal as he worked skilfully on her nipple and between her own direct stimulation and the enjoyment Zal was providing she found release and was breathing heavily as she caught her breath. So heavily infact that the wobble produced to her breasts tumbled Zal between them.  
“Zal where did you learn that…you little sweetheart!”  
She smiled in the afterglow of her excitement and looked down at him.  
“Now I think its time you showed me if that’s a laser gun your hiding in your little trousers there?”  
He failed to get her humour .  
“im not armed Tiffani only a stun unit?”  
“I can see im going to have to be more direct…Zal why don’t you take off your clothes for me and Ill show you how much fun you can have with us giant earth girls ok?”  
An enthusiastic grin lined his face as he removed his clothes and her hand lifted all of them up one at a time fascinated with how tiny and detailed they were. She placed them down onto the side cabinet and looked back to see it was only his underwear left.  
“why don’t you take off all of your clothes Zal you’ve seen most of me “  
Zal wasn’t shy but he was feeling a little insecure knowing that the extent of his manhood was miniscule to this giantess. As he removed his underwear he stood naked with his proud length pointing up and becoming unbearable as the burning was now at full force.  
“You sure are firm aren’t you? And so perfect”  
Her huge white teeth flashed brilliantly as she looked approvingly down at his body. Forgetting where her right hand had been she removed it from her skirt and went to touch the tip of his member with the pad of her longest finger. Instantly Zal smelt the strong fragrance of her sex upon her fingers and could see the wet lingering juices coating them.  
“That’s so wonderful”  
He said before she had even touched him  
“what is?”  
“Your scent on your fingers it smells like a concentrated version of the pheromone our women use for attracting men”  
“Oh I didn’t think…”  
Tiffani withdrew her finger before they touched him but then realised what he was saying he liked her smell.  
“…well I guess if you like it there’s more where that came from a lot more”  
She began to sit upright making Zal fall back but using her other arm and hand she had anticipated his new position as she suspended her boobs from beneath supporting them and allowing them to press nicely together to form a tight recess that held Zal who now laid across its length. He was suddenly caressed by her boob flesh from all sides gazing up from the cleavage line he rested so comfortably along to see her face peering down at him. His hands and arms were restricted infact he was gently held and unable to move and totally at her mercy.  
“If I die on this planet let it be here and now”  
He sighed  
“You know Zal you are the ideal size for a boyfriend, you see my cleavage its so much bigger than you are isn’t this sexy?”  
If he could have nodded his head he would have yet his whole body was firmly embraced by warm flesh moulding to his form.  
“the, the burning I need the deliverance!”  
He began to get breathless as he knew he must have relief soon.  
“deliverance , oh that’s right you told me that you guys get a little too horny”  
He watched as her enormous fingers returned this time almost dripping with her love juices and they softly traced along his torso and thighs circling his manhood in a thick trail of warm almost hot liquid until finally one of those enormous fingers rubbed against his rod so delicately covering his shaft and helmet in one mere fraction of a finger tip. If being lovingly held in her giant breasts wasn’t enough he now had the sensation of her giant fingers fondling him all over and then she began to breathe a warm tingling gust of her minty breath from her huge mouth above , pursing her lips together in a seductive pout as she exhaled across her cleavage.  
“I am yours forever goddess!”  
He grandly burst out in climax as he spurted his seed like a fountain. Amazed at her own sexual powers Tiffani used a dry finger to lift some of his excitement so she could taste it. The small spot she applied to her lips she could hardly see yet even this almost microscopic amount produce an unusual tingling to her tongue.  
“all burnt out now spaceman?”  
She grinned  
“thank you Tiffani I shall always remember this”  
”Guess no girl back home could do this with you…. none of them would ever measure up to me eh?”  
“never”  
Using another Kentucky wipe Zal cleaned himself up as Tiffani placed him down on the cabinet beside his clothes and cleaned herself up.  
“I think your stay here Zal is going to be very enjoyable”  
She gave him a sexy look as she bared her back to him removing her skirt and panties below. Her backside was every bit as impressive in the flesh as he had imagined and he was in awe of how divinely sculpted her body was. Tiffani looked over her shoulder aware of his stare.  
“im always a bit conscious my butt is large but I guess I cant hide this from you can I?”  
“Its holds no flaws like the rest of you Tiffani even to the detail that small eyes like mine can behold”  
“wouldn’t want me to sit on you with it though , would you?”  
She backed up pretending to lower her massive pert rear down upon him. He was in instant shadow and aware , fully aware of its imposing size to him.  
“I wouldn’t survive but it would be a nice all the same”  
He laughed as she stood up straight offering the towering tops of the backs of her thighs to his view as her nicely rounded rear jutted softly out in its smooth curve.  
“You cant still be horny are you?”  
“a Tallion male is always ready for love Tiffani but I am quite satisfied”  
“im glad tiny because this giantess is tired”  
He watched her find a long t-shirt to wear to bed which she pulled over her head as she turned around. His eyes were denied a glimpse of her womanhood as the t-shirt settled just below it.  
“Well my little boyfriend its time for some shut eye, oh that means sleep so…”  
She picked him up in her hand and pressed him to her lips , without the lipstick he felt just a moist blanket of warmth. Tiffani held him whilst she reached under her bed and found a shoe box. Tipping a pair of high heeled sandals out she grabbed her white bra and lined the box with it so as one cup settled under the other re-inforcing its shape. Placing Zal into the cup of her bra she couldn’t help but smile at how cute he looked in her enormous underwear.  
“like your BIG bed?”  
  
##Part 9  
  
She emphasized the big in her words to make him feel small as he looked at the tall circular lacy walls that surrounded him more than amply.  
“I shall lie here and think of you”  
“ I bet you will , oh and ive got something else for you incase you get cold or incase you get horny during the night”  
With a smirk she lifted her panties over the box and almost smothered him in the mass of silk that was laced with traces of her scent.  
“You know you’d fit into my panties just as well as you fit inside my bras Zal, I can think of so many sexy ways to carry such a cute little pocket sized boyfriend like you”  
He was left with that thought as she placed the box under her bed and plunged the bedroom into darkness as she retired to her bed high above him.  
  
“Hey sleepy head Ive been calling you!”  
Both Zal and Tiffani awoke to her mothers voice. She was in the room and from the shoe box Zal couldn’t see where. He looked for his clothes she hadn’t placed them with him. Naked he pushed off the panties and looked up at the walls of the bra and the sides of the cardboard box beyond. The smooth bra would be challenge enough to scale let alone the smooth walls of the box. He decided he had little choice but to stay quite and listen.  
“Oh mum , whats the time”  
”Its half eight your normally leaving by now whats got into you girl?”  
”I didn’t set my alarm guess I was shattered”  
Tiffani reached for her alarm it was the truth and she could have kicked herself.  
“Well hop to it young lady”  
“thanks”  
Her mum began to walk out when she spotted something on the cabinet  
“Tiff what are these? Your not still playing with dolls are you?”  
In horror Tiffani looked on as her mum picked up Zals flight suit holding it inquisitively before her eyes. Tiffani sprung up and took it from her mother  
“No its just a repair , a repair im doing, I mean I did last night for Corrina’s little brothers action doll guess I worked so hard I didn’t realise the time so I overslept.  
“mm, nice to see your developing some practical skills you’ll be knitting next”  
Her mum laughed and left the room  
“Zal you ok?”  
He felt the whole box shift as Tiffani slid it from under the bed forcing him to fall over and get covered by her panties.  
“ha”  
She laughed  
“morning cutey”  
“good morning yourself”  
He smiled up.  
“listen im running late for college so I’ve gotta bolt, will you be ok here?”  
“You could get me my things and lift me out of this box?”  
No sooner had he made the request he was in her palm and carried to the cabinet to dress. Tiffani tore around the room throwing clothes on the bed and running off to shower. Returning Zal was dressed and sat on a book ready to watch her dress. She slipped on some underwear still with her back to him and pulled on a fresh white bra from her cabinet.  
“geez this is tight”  
She moaned adjusting the straps on her shoulders.  
“these just seem to get bigger and bigger don’t they?”  
Turning he feasted his eyes on a bra that was struggling to hold the fullness of her bust but a bra that was more exciting to behold for just that reason.  
“It is only you who would complain about their size Tiffani for me I am drowning in there impressiveness”  
“flatterer , but keep that thought I might drown you in them for real later on”  
She grabbed a pair of tights and split them as she tried to pull them up her legs.  
“what gives?”  
Throwing them on the floor she decided bare legs would suffice and reached for her black trousers. As she slipped the trousers on she had the most unexpected sight.  
“Impossible?”  
Zal looked on not following her comments.  
“Zal look you can see my ankles in these?”  
“and?”  
“well these aren’t ankle tappers”  
She removed her trousers and offered up a long dark grey skirt to her legs.  
“this as well?”  
“Tiffani whats wrong?”  
“Zal I cant believe im saying this but either my clothes have shrunk overnight or ive grown?”  
“do earth females grow that quickly?”  
The question came in all innocence  
“no we don’t and I have pretty much stopped growing taller or so I thought?”  
She rushed in just her underwear to a height chart affixed to the back of her door made to look like a comical giraffe.  
“I keep meaning to get rid off this , mum put it in here when I was in puberty but Im glad she did now. Zal can you see how tall I am can you read this from there?”  
He peered across the vast room and made out the figures.  
“68 point 5”  
Zal announced.  
“Tiffani spun around in disbelief  
“5ft 8? No way! Are you sure? Come here”  
She walked over and picked Zal up taking him over to the chart. Pressing her back flat to it and her head she placed him gently on top of her long blonde head of hair. Zal got the idea he waded waist deep into the long hair and parted its volume to see where the chart indicated exactly at the back of her head.  
“just under 69 inches , then you have grown Tiffani by nearly two and three quarters of your earth inches that’s phenomenal you’ve increased your height well over ten feet over night?”  
He walked around on her head back to the front feeling its light touch around his exposed manhood as it brushed against it. It didn’t take more than a few steps and he was hard. Reaching him down carefully she held him in her palm and saw his arousal.  
“hey are you that pleased im over ten feet taller? You realise it makes me even more impossibly giant sized to you little man”  
“It was your hair that did this but your size is very exciting to me all the same”  
“you are so honest”  
He was held in her hand for a second whilst she let her hair fall forward and smothered him in its length. Each strand tickled him in a sexual manor as she let him enjoy the feeling of her hair surrounding him.  
As she flung her hair back he was as hard as iron and smiling up.  
“sorry Zal I don’t think I have time to play now especially as Ive got to find something that fits”  
She placed him on the bed as she rifled through her clothes for college and ended up in the same long skirt as before but this time wearing some black high heeled boots with it that barely fitted. She then found a white sweater and looked at herself in her mirror.  
“Zal do you realise in these boots Im going to be as tall as Corrina is and im already as tall as my mum without them this is weird”  
“Are you concerned Tiffani because it does look good on you”  
His compliment was well received but unnecessary as she was delighted in her new stature  
“No I love it Ive always wanted to be taller but I never guessed I would grow anymore its plain weird but I guess anything’s possible I mean just look at me ive got a less than two inch alien boyfriend staying with me”  
“It sounds irregular I will med-scan your body if you let me”  
He began to retrieve a device from his suit when Tiffani picked him up.  
“Look im really sorry to run sweet thing but college calls , Im going to see if I can get out early ok? Do you need anything whilst im gone , I know you don’t need food with that nutrient thingy you mentioned but what about water a drink of some kind?”  
“I don’t require anything like that the sustaining tablet we take ensure we don’t need to drink and I don’t have the requirement for relieving food and liquid”  
“You don’t go to the toilet?”  
“toilet? That’s what you once told me about its your body waste disposal area? , no Im good for a few days yet even a week as long as I take my tablets.”  
“wish I had some of them”  
Tiffani grinned and placed him at her feet.  
“Look Zal im going to leave you down here but please don’t go exploring ok it’s a big house you could get hurt and mums still home, I promise ill be back in about six or seven hours”  
“Ill be fine ive survived on Terrelinac in the storm season your bedroom will be no challenge believe me ill kill time honing my scans for Trelan deposits”  
Looking up the tremendous tower of her body he couldn’t wait until she returned  
“take care”  
She blew down a kiss and left him. Zal wandered around the room taking in the sights of her building sized furniture . He then spotted the shoes she had taken out of the box he slept in and fascinated himself with their enormity. One of the sandals had fallen upright and he climbed into its grand interior. It was hard for him to take in that the object of his fantasies Tiffani was so gigantic yet here he was in her shoe a shoe as big as a Xyrian interceptor craft. His thoughts led to the onset of the burning, he decided to relieve himself but where would he have this pleasure? In her shoe? Although it was stimulating to look at imagining her stepping inside he knew where he wanted to go he found the discarded tights she had attempted to wear , like the bra and panties the smooth light material was foreign to Zal so delicate and sensual. Discovering the entrance to them he lifted up a section and crawled down the long , long leg until he was immersed in its softness. He unzipped his suit and commenced bringing himself to the deliverance when suddenly he heard the door open and the thuds of huge feet! Shocked he froze and lay prone so as he didn’t pronounce his body in the tights. He covered his manhood up once more and hoped he wasn’t spotted.  
“well , well Tiffani what do we have here? A bra and knickers in a shoe box?”  
It was her mum the same voice as before Zal cowered as her feet grew closer and he felt the floor vibrate and suddenly the tights were moved she was picking them up! Zals body was rushed to the toe end of the stockings as her mum held them from above and through the sheer material he could see her face a large beautiful face dangling him before it.  
“what’s this?”  
He had been discovered and she had him caught as if he was in a fishing net. In an impulse reaction he grabbed a small plasma cutter from his belt and proceeded to slice the material around him until he fell.  
Saying he hadn’t thought this action out was an understatement as he watched some long bare legs flash past his eyes as he fell to his impending doom down their considerable length until by pure luck more than judgement he fell on a clump of Tiffani’s clothes. The very top and skirt she had removed last night and they now served as a life saver cushioning his fall. Her mother was surprised and watched as he tumbled and found his feet. He sprinted over the spongy terrain of the giant clothes making it to the carpet. Running as if his life depended on it he made for the only sanctuary he could find which was beneath one of the high rise wardrobes. Several thuds impressed the carpet before him as he witnessed some enormous bare feet slam down before the edge of the wardrobe he was hiding under.  
“Its ok little man you don’t have to be scared im Tiffani’s mum I wont hurt you”  
Her voice sounded genuine and totally un-phased by seeing him which Zal didn’t understand.  
“Look I know it must be very scary to see giant women like me especially women you don’t know but my daughters treated you well hasn’t she so you know you can trust me”  
Zal noted he had lost his plasma cutter in all the action and cussed , the gap beneath the wardrobe was about an inch high so he was crouching uncomfortably.  
“Im going to back away I guess my huge feet here are a terribly imposing sight for such a tiny guy like you”  
Her feet receded a great distance away in a few steps and Zal peered out from the edge of the wardrobe.  
“Aah there you are its ok little one . My names Sandy im Tiffani’s mother”  
Looking up he could see the same attractive woman he’d glimpsed the other night , today she was wearing a tight red skirt and a creamy coloured silk blouse and to Zal she was a vision. A smile crossed her face and she put her head to one side as she looked down.  
“Your from Tallion aren’t you?”  
How did she know that! Zal looked on amazed still unable to venture out.  
“Its alright I know your from outer space I once met a little man like yourself from Tallion. It looks like my daughters had a close encounter as well, welcome to Earth”  
Zal stepped out into the open  
“Im pleased to meet you Sandy my names Zal”  
  
##Part 10  
  
“The pleasures all mine little Zal, may I kneel down its hard to speak when im all the way up here”  
Gracefully he watched the giantess descend and was able to see her smiling face much closer.  
“So Zal my little girl is your girlfriend eh? she did say her boyfriend was small but your more tiny than small”  
That was a statement he couldn’t challenge looking up at her.  
“So how did you know I was from Tallion you don’t seem shocked at all to see me?”  
“How about we discuss that as we get to know each other little Zal why don’t you let me carry you down stairs so we can chat a bit comfier”  
“I suppose”  
Agreeing he stepped towards her as she laid her massive hand down palm side up like a waiting platform to elevate him to her level. As he stepped upon it she gently raised him as she also stood up herself.  
“and Sandy could you just call me Zal I feel small enough without the little in the description”  
”well your stood in the palm of my hand and im a woman who is probably hundreds of feet tall compared to you so I think little is a compliment for someone your size”  
Zal noticed her demeanour seemed different somehow since he was in her grasp.  
“so little Tallion space man lets get acquainted shall we?”  
“err sure Sandy”  
“That’s Mistress Sandy to you”  
“Im sorry, what?”  
”Ill let you off this one time but from now on you’ll refer to me as Mistress Sandy is that clear?”  
Her tone was authoritive clear and presented in a fashion that Zal was beginning not to agree with.  
“So lets go to my bedroom and begin our relationship tiny.”  
Suddenly he was afraid a growing concern that this giant had some evil agenda.  
“Im going to drop you in my blouse pocket up here so make sure you don’t move about… this is pure silk and very expensive I don’t want to see any little creases in it”  
Zal was dropped a couple of feet in his scales from her fingers and plunged into the smooth silky confines of her blouse pocket which was far taller than he was restricting any chance he had of looking out. As she walked he jostled around with the sway of her giant breasts which he may have enjoyed but for now he was worried about the plans this giant woman had for him.  
“Sandy let me out please I don’t want to be in here”  
Upon hearing him calling out she seemed to shake her breasts purposely in a rapid fashion left and right which plastered him in the silky walls this way and that. It didn’t hurt the material was far too soft but it demonstrated what a simple action could do to him. Reaching her bedroom Sandy didn’t answer his repeated calls until she lifted him free between two fingers and dangled him before her face with a large grin.  
“Oh its all coming back to me now I remember how much fun it was to feel so powerful, now little tiny man I said address me as Mistress Sandy and you haven’t been listening to your Mistress have you?”  
Zal hung in the air looking down what to him was the sight of her body stretching down close to two hundred foot beneath him as his legs danced in the air and he felt the two nails pinched together onto the back of his flight suits collar ease their grip.  
“Please don’t drop me from this height!”  
He didn’t want to show any fear but he was compelled to plead with her.  
“Please Mistress Sandy”  
“That’s better now you appreciate my size and you know if you fell from anything greater than the level of my ankles you wouldn’t survive and certainly not from how high up Im holding you now”  
She lowered him inside a large silver jewellery box on top of her mahogany dresser. It was empty and lined in red felt. Zal saw the hinged lid poised up above and the walls all smooth and with no possibility of offering him hand or foot holds surrounding him like the perimeter of a an improvised miniature prison.  
“that’s more like it”  
She began looming over the box seeing how he had no hope of climbing out.  
“You and I are going to become very close little Zal , very close indeed”  
“Mistress Sandy please tell me why you are doing this to me?”  
He assumed pandering to the name she proposed may get her to reveal more.  
“because I can little man, a woman like me can do anything she wants with a tiny man like you , anything I desire”  
She laughed and he saw her sliding some clips from her hair shaking it free from its restrained style.  
“many years ago I thought I had witnessed a comet plummeting down from the night sky and I followed its bright light until I found a tiny space ship that had crashed landed in the fields behind my house. There was this little man such a cutie so much like you infact , he must have been so startled when this huge pretty giantess picked up his ship in her hands. I recall that I took him and the craft inside the house and there I was thinking it was some flying toy when out he came to communicate, this itsy bitsy man who looked more like a toy.”  
“My father!”  
Zal exclaimed  
“You don’t say, this is too good to be true little Zal”  
She smiled down over the jewellery box  
“so now I get to play with the younger model , how wonderful”  
“Mistress Sandy , please what happened to my father when he was discovered by you?”  
Desperate for knowledge but equally wishing to distract her Zal questioned hoping to delay whatever fate she had in store for him.  
“I treated him very well Zal made him very welcome. Your father and I became very close just like you and I will soon become. Im so glad I found out my daughter had a little man but it wasn’t hard was it little Zal the clues where all there…the way she was acting the other night and her description of you … and of course I noticed she looked taller today as she left it was all so abnormal and to top it off the little shoe box for a bed filled with my little girls underwear ready for a man to sleep in.”  
“You noticed Tiffani is taller? What has that got to do with me?”  
”everything little Zal don’t you know?”  
He looked blank his mind searching for an answer as Sandy laughed a roaring laugh that was very loud.  
“You really don’t know do you?”  
Sandy reached down into the jewellery box and lifted him into her left hand. Clasped in her fist she smiled a knowing kind of smile and walked towards her bed.  
“Have you suffered the burning yet Zal or are you still fresh and waiting for pleasure?”  
“I err, no I haven’t , whats going on , where are you taking me?”  
Considerably more nervous now he couldn’t fight the grip that held him as her huge hand placed him down upon her skirted lap. She was sat perched on the edge of her bed and Zal stood up balancing upon the taught red material that suspended him. Instinctively he looked down over the edge of the skirt and saw the very long drop below framed by her two lovely legs.  
“I shouldn’t get to near the edge of my skirt little one you might fall”  
Zal turned and looked up to see the tremendous silk blouse towering over his head with her face just visible over her bust.  
“You see your father and I had an arrangement little Zal , he needed a place to stay a place where such an insect of man could be protected from the danger of us giants and in return he offered me something special.”  
“my father has never spoken of earth what is it he offered?”  
“His seed little Zal he offered me his wonderful seed. You see there’s something fantastic about anything from your world when it comes into contact with this one your father seemed to know the reasons why but lets just say your packing the most amazing growth formula inside that little dinky equipment between those legs of yours and I want some more”  
“growth formula?”  
“why yes little Zal, that extraterrestrial sperm you little pocket sized Tallions produce has such a wondrous reaction with us giant earth women and make us grow into even taller giants”  
His face paled as her words continued  
“You see I kind of found this out by accident with your father and when I did well lets say he almost became my little living lolly pop for a while and with every suck I became taller”  
Zal could see all to well where this was going and desperately looked over her red covered thighs to see if he could dare leap to the bed and flee her clutches. But it was an impossible jump her backside barely rested a fraction of its mass on the bed and that meant a long drop either side of her skirt to the floor.  
“There’s no where to run and hide little Zal you should relax and enjoy the fruits of a mature woman a giantess who knows how to be a giantess”  
Her hand clasped its long thick fingers around him.  
“now lets see what’s under those cute little doll clothes shall we?”  
“No please don’t”  
With his arms now pinned back by her fingers he watched helplessly as her other hand came in and began to remove his flight suit by ripping it away with a solitary finger nail. The long talon of a finger nail from this woman behaved like a metal blade as it tore easily the fabric of his clothing and before Zal knew it Tiffani’s mother had stripped him naked as the day he was born and his suit fell to the floor in tatters.  
“you are so fragile aren’t you little one I shall have to be careful not to damage my new toy”  
“Please no”  
“Now don’t be afraid you’re a man and every man likes a woman to take charge its just that in your case im a giant woman and that gives you no choice in the matter”  
Another laugh left her lips as she gently ran the pad of her finger along his legs and to his manhood. But for once in his life in the presence of a beautiful woman Zal wasn’t hard or even aroused he was scared, scared of what this woman was capable of and how small he was in her powerful hands.  
“Sandy this isn’t right I don’t want this”  
His words fell of deaf ears as Sandy noticed the lack of excitement to his flaccid organ.  
“This wont do at all, I see that im going to have to tease this teeny little excuse of a prick into life because I can hardly see it right now and I need what’s inside it”  
She placed him down on her lap and he looked up fearing her next action. Slowly and seductively he saw her hands reach across her chest and she began to unbutton her top blouse buttons.  
“That’s it little baby you look right up here because mummy’s got something very big for you”  
As her blouse fell slack a huge black bra exposed itself from beneath and her giant breasts came into focus. Despite being smaller in this department than her daughter they still stood out like small hills to Zal each many times bigger than himself.  
“So what do you think of your Mistress now eh little man? Would you like to play up here inside my bra would that get you excited? It worked with your father…”  
Before he could answer her hand lifted him to her bra and Zal found himself tucked into the left cup almost facing her nipple. Part of him was beginning to get aroused he couldn’t help it this huge warm breast felt so good against his skin and so enormous as his body was pushed gently into it volume thanks to the tight material behind his back.  
“Your father had a thing for my breasts little Zal lets see if it runs in the family shall we?”  
Sandy noticed he was hardly daring to move and decided to increase her teasing to another level, he watched through the net like structure to his side as her blouse was removed and very soon the bra that he was held in! He was suddenly forced to clasp his hands around her nipple to avoid falling to her lap which was a long way below. As he dangled holding on like a mountain climber who was hanging from the highest precipice without a rope he looked down at her half naked body stretching its firm form for almost forty feet beneath him. Her breasts stood out proud and left him high up unable to release.  
“so, so fragile”  
She repeated watching his predicament with great interest as she realized the peril this simple action of hers had caused him. Zal felt her nipple expand it swelled in his hands over his head, she was turned on by this or was it his touch?  
“I , I cant hold on much longer”  
He called out.  
“then let go little man”  
A small shake of her breast and Zal had no choice in the matter he fell but landed in the softness of the palm of her hand with great relief.  
“Now lets see if I still have what it takes to get a little toy-man excited”  
Held in her fingers she ran his naked body so gently around the huge curves of her breasts so the soft flesh kissed every part of him.  
“My breasts are so gigantic to you aren’t they tiny? So sexy and enormous to such a little bitty man”  
  
##Part 11  
  
Zal succumbed to her teasing unable to resist the sensations forced upon him and soon his hard member was pointing up and obvious to this giantess.  
“there that’s more like it , I know what gets you going now tiny and who could blame you ive got nice big breasts and soon there going to be even bigger once you share that little magic with me”  
Taken swiftly by her giant fingers he was presented to a pair of lips that consumed his manhood in a moist embrace. He felt his length laying between the huge pillows as they moved delicately upon it pressing into his stomach and chest whilst simultaneously pressing upon his balls and upper thighs. It was a too much for Zal to ignore she had him at his most vulnerable and found himself uncontrollably enjoying her attentions. In seconds he released that enjoyment and her head tipped back purposely to ensure she missed not a drop of his fluids. When he felt his organ stop pumping Sandy lifted him to her hand as he laid there spent and confused.  
“that tastes better than I remember , thank you little man that should be enough to make me a few inches taller until later”  
She grinned and Zal with his head swirling was lowered into her jewellery box to recover. He looked up as she replaced her bra and blouse.  
“I haven’t decided when Ill stop but definitely not until im the better side of 6ft tall, it will be a shock for my husband but then you men all like leggy women eh? You know I didn’t get more than two of these delightful treatments from your father before he and I parted company but that was enough to take me from a lowly 5ft 4 to my current 5ft 9 so I may even reach 6ft with this little bit of fun we had.”  
”Mistress Sandy this isn’t right you should…”  
“Don’t ever tell me what is right or wrong my little toy-man. You gave up your seed willingly in appreciation of my body so this is nature and I deserve to be taller and a more dominant female its fate that’s what’s has brought us together”  
Her hands came in around him as he felt the cold of a heavy chain being attached around his waist, he struggled but she probably didn’t notice as a large fist sized catch clicked behind his back.  
“there im sorry about this tiny but Im not about to loose you. You can roam around my jewellery box but this necklace of mine will stop any ideas you have of leaving, well that’s if the sides of this box aren’t tall enough already, ha!”  
Sandy walked off and called back  
“Im going shopping for my new outfits to befit my new stature so you behave now you hear? Oh and start brewing some more of that growing potion Ill be wanting seconds when I return”  
The silence of the house fell on Zal as he looked sadly at what he had been reduced to. Here he was a man, a traveller , a brave explorer of many galaxies who had been captured by a mere woman who had him completely at her beckon call. But she wasn’t just a woman she was a giantess an manipulative giantess who was some kind of size vampire taking sexual advantage of him to gain height inch by inch and where would this stop? Would she keep him once she found the height she yearned to be or would he be passed around to other such women?  
Casting off these thoughts he looked at the situation he was faced with. She had placed two circular bands of a thick necklace around his waist and clipped it behind him. The remainder of the chain traveled up and was fastened around the rectangular metal fixture that accepted the closing catch of the boxes lid. So he was tied like a Premethian hound on a lead. The metal he recognized as he held its heavy weight in his palms and tested its strength it was Trelan! In reality what Zal identified as Trelan was infact common gold and this golden necklace held enough raw material to address the repairs on his ship. It was odd to Zal that a material they used in manufacturing of space craft engines these earth females chose to wear around their necks as decorative ornaments. The necklace was heavy and made Zal exert a lot of energy just to move around the box interior as he contemplated what to do, he was resourceful he had to come up with something, he had to escape. Although the sides of the box were impossible to scale he now had this chain running up to the catch receptacle and this presented itself as a rope to Zal. He climbed feeling the pull of the chain around him as it dangled heavily. With all his muscles flexing for what they were worth he managed to make the top lip of the box and rested as he straddled the box. Reaching behind he twisted the chains around his waist until the necklace catch was before him. It was a simple mechanism with a small bar he had to pull back that would open a section of the gold circle so the trapped link could be set free. With both arms he pulled , he strained and did little to shift the bar, how pathetic would he look to those giantesses now as with all his upper arm strength combined he was unable to move something that they would slide effortlessly with a finger nail. With a major frown of frustration upon his face he sunk to his knees panting gently from the exertion and then inspiration struck him. His sub dermal communicator! Zals hand reached his left forearm and his fingers searched across the tissue for a small raised bump hardly noticeable even to himself. He pressed hard his thumb to the skin activating the circuitry of this device that all well equipped traders and explorers often injected into their bodies as a last resort measure for assistance. A signal was generated from his body back to his space craft alerting the one and only rescue drone. Zal waited patiently. Within a short time period he heard the hover thrusters of the small drone as it rose above the jewellery case having locked onto his signal location and presumably fashioned its own entrance to the house. The rescue drone was often employed to assist the crew of a craft when in peril and reacted to voice commands.  
“Drone cut this chain”  
“Affirmative master , responding”  
Its synthetic voice complied and it lowered its spherical form towards Zal and a small hatch revealed itself with a tiny cutting wheel. The blade made of chiraniman alloy cut through the gold like a hot knife through butter and soon Zal was free.  
“Drone lift me free of this prison”  
A purple coloured capture beam used for shifting objects of large sizes emitted from the drone covering Zal and levitated him into the air and the drone flew Zal and itself up into the air. He instructed the drone to deposit him on the floor as he searched for his shredded uniform finding only a few remnants it was beyond repair but some of his technology was salvageable.  
“Drone replicate spare uniform to my parameters”  
“Complying”  
The drone answered and set to work almost miraculously materializing a crisp new uniform before Zals feet in a matter of seconds he only wished the internal replicater could produce Trelan and such materials but it was a basic unit . He swiftly put the fresh uniform on.  
“Drone retrieve the chain you severed to free me and verify if it is composed or Trelan?”  
Using its capture beam the drone returned with the chain in its entirety suspended it in the air before Zal hovering less than a real inch above the carpet.  
“Analysis complete 95% Trelan , 5% impurities origin and identification unable to define”  
“Well its not pure but it will do the job”  
“Drone return this to the ship and await contact”  
“complying”  
The small drone began to move off towards the bedroom door and flew off down the staircase. Zal walked back to Tiffani’s room wondering what he was going to do it seemed very unsafe based on his experience with her mother to remain there and he thought about leaving Tiffani a message and getting the Drone to carrying him back to his ship. As he wandered her bedroom floor he heard the door open down stairs and an explosion of sorts? He hid as fast as he could using the leg post of the bed to shield him from view. A minute later he heard the giant thuds of feet coming to the bedroom and he closed his eyes briefly fearing Sandy’s return.  
“Zal baby are you in here?”  
“Tiffani!”  
He called out and almost ran to see her giant black boots striding into the room.  
“Tiffani down here!”  
”Hi baby pleased to see me?”  
”Am I ever!”  
He said in enthusiastically as he almost hugged the toe of her left boot in a welcoming embrace.  
“That’s sweet , let me pick you up”  
Her familiar hand picked him up and he was plastered with a loving kiss from her giant lips.  
“I couldn’t resist popping home for lunch to see you , have you a had a nice morning?”  
Zal relayed his morning censoring parts he really didn’t want her to hear of how her mother practically raped him.  
“God im so sorry Zal what can I say , my own mum treating you this way that was cruel , please forgive me for leaving you I had no idea”  
“Tiffani its ok im fine my drone released me and whats better news is it should be on its way to my ship with all the Trelan I need”  
“Oh, when you say Trelan do you mean my mothers necklace she tied you up with?”  
”Yes its composed of Trelan”  
“this necklace?”  
From her skirt pocket she produced the snapped chain before Zal.  
“Im afraid when I stepped in the door I trod on something and it went bang under my boot , erm I think that was your drone thingy because I found my mums necklace by the little bits of broken metal, sorry”  
Zal smiled at her it was an accident but without his rescue drone he really was on his own now.  
“Its not your fault you wouldn’t have seen it”  
”Listen Zal I can carry you to your ship tonight after college and you can melt down my mums necklace it’s the least she can offer you , im gonna have words with her tonight”  
Her tone was mad at her mothers behavior which she found inexcusable and so out of character.  
Carrying Zal to her bed she clutched him protectively to her chest almost enveloping him in the soft white sweater she was wearing as he nestled there in bliss.  
“Zal do you know why us women here grow taller by coming into contact with Tallions?”  
She looked down at the small figure who’s face was muffled by her top and moved him out a little so he could reply.  
“I have no idea, I need to check it out. Listen Tiffani is it really safe for me to remain here I mean your mother overpowered me so easily I have to admit I do feel vulnerable”  
“Its ok Zal I will straighten out things with my mum mean-time I have a study period at the library for a few hours this afternoon we can find a quiet cubicle so you can come with me..”  
“Im not so sure”  
  
##Part 12  
  
He began to think of the mass of giants he could potentially encounter in a public place.  
“Don’t worry Ill look after you besides I told Corrina all about you today Ive been busting to do that for so long and she is so excited to meet you”  
“Corrina, can she be trusted?”  
“Zal she is my best friend a very special friend.. I trust her and besides she knew something was up as she wasn’t looking down on me so much today she noticed the extra inches right away I had to open up to her. But she’s cool although half of me thinks she doesn’t believe me entirely about you. Anyhow she’s in the library this afternoon and you did say you would like to meet a 6ft plus girl”  
“that was when I thought she was just a few inches taller than me but now she’ll be the tallest giantess Ive ever seen and believe me your tall enough to be around”  
A cheeky smile crossed her face and she began to walk downstairs with Zal held before her , as they reached the door Tiffani raised him slowly to her face.  
“You know I was day dreaming about us in class today Zal thinking about our size difference and imagining what I must look like to you”  
“You look beautiful”  
He backed his compliment with a smile  
“I was thinking how enormous my body must be and even more so now I have grown and then I began to think of the sexy dimensions of my body , like these hundred plus foot long legs of mine. Oh and then theres these hands which must be around 9 foot wide. Even my feet to you must be as long as 20 or more foot it must be such a sight for you.”  
“One Im happy to gaze upon my giantess”  
“Well the dimensions I know you love are also gigantic and even more sexy under this top im wearing. I think if my math’s are good each of my breasts here must be over 20 foot wide to you and as a giantess my cleavage has got to be a lot more than ten feet long am I right?”  
She tilted his view and he could see over her hand as her spare hand pulled the neck of her tight top open exposing what to Zal was a world of cleavage.  
“a lot more….”  
The words trickled off his tongue as it began to hang out along with his eyes in a lustful stare  
“good then that means there’s plenty of room for tiny little you to ride in between my sexy boobs”  
Suddenly he found himself lowered down the neck of her top and under the white cotton until his body was gently squeezed into the mouth of her heaving cleavage as it effortlessly accommodated him in a firm sexy hold.  
“You look so cute in there and so tiny! Sorry if it’s a bouncy ride Zal a bra can only do so much and they are a bit on the large side. Ill speak to you when we get there cutey , enjoy yourself”  
She sniggered allowing her top to close over his head as she spied the last view of her boyfriend tucked safely in her charms. The walk to her college library was ten minutes long and Zal reveled in every second as he was jostled delightfully in her breast flesh he wondered how he could ever feel happy with regular breasts upon Tallion women back on his planet after experiencing Tiffani and her mega breasts which would have been very arousing if they shared equal stature but with her being a giantess they took on a sexiness that he found a hundred times more stimulating. It wasn’t long before he was feeling the familiar tight swell in his flight suit beckoning his attention. Entering the library Tiffani grabbed the books she had reserved previously and made her way to the corner reading cubicle which shrouded the view of anyone within so she felt it would be safe to bring her tiny boyfriend out and onto the table.  
Lifted free from her top and out through the neck of her sweater Zal was very hot and extremely excited.  
“I see you enjoyed the accommodation mmm?”  
“I cant help it Tiffani. Simply looking at your breasts is enough to excite me but you placing me between them charges my plasma drives!”  
“I can see that”  
She winked at him as he was settled onto a wooden table aside a thick text book and under a brass reading lamp.  
“would you like some release Zal? Whilst no one is around? I assume you are due for a discharge with that burning you told me about”  
He knew she was right he was feeling the early on-set of the burning and sexual release would be ideal at this stage, he meekly nodded.  
“Ok baby Ill make this a quickie, how about you make love to my nipple would that be sexy little guy?”  
Slowly he watched her peel her top over her tremendous breasts and slipped her left bra cup down so it settled under her very large and very thick nipple.  
“I was thinking that you might be able to push right into it if you really try and the thought of you doing it with my nipple is quite erotic”  
“I will never be able to reach up there my goddess”  
Tiffani loved his use of the term goddess and sexily smiled  
“then the beautiful goddess will raise the tiny mortal so he can worship her giant breast”  
Carefully she leveled him between two fingers clasping around the waist as she offered him to the enormous end of her nipple he could see that it was almost wider than him and easily 3ft long. Opening the lower portion of his flight suit he eased his eager manhood out. The tip of her nipple engulfed his small offering and seemed to clasp it in a duct in its surface and he felt the connection as if he was sinking his length into her sex only his eyes beheld not her womanhood but a colossal breast before him that gently moved its mass as his body began to enthusiastically pump against it. He flung his arms around the enormity of her flesh barely holding a fraction of its giant form as he pressed himself enthusiastically into it enjoying the sensation.  
“Oh that’s good Zal so, so sensitive”  
He was overwhelmed by his own actions , he felt insignificant to Tiffani yet somehow upon her great breast he was connected to her , loving her , loving her breast.  
“Zal more please”  
She released a series of louder sighs and he knew this was as stimulating to her which spurred Zal on making him buck into her flesh in a frenzy until his passion was at fever pitch.  
“yyyesss!!”  
He cried out and luckily his voice didn’t carry well in the isolated part of the library so no one heard him cum. Seeing him began to spurt his fluid Tiffani grinned and plucked him from one nipple and onto the other ensuring to trap his manhood in a similar fashion in its tip. As Zal recovered in the palm of her hand she licked his length clean so he could cover it up once more. He found himself on the table below her looking up as she placed her bra back over her bare breasts with the evident bumps of her nipples that looked like warheads from two missiles to Zal.  
“You nearly had me orgasm then you little beauty”  
She smiled down conscious of her nipple showing her arousal as her thin bra did little to flatten them.  
“I didn’t know it was possible from attention to my breasts alone they feel so much more sensitive then ever before thanks to you and so much bigger”  
Zal watched in awe as she said that comment and suddenly both her breasts swelled just slowly, expanding beneath her bra , filling her bra and threatening to spill out of its now too small capacity.  
“Your breasts”  
He gazed up in a lustful stare as they dominated more of his vision as they grew larger by the second.  
“oh my, their growing Zal look my boobs are filling out”  
In seconds this amazing sight ceased as they settled in size making Tiffani look extremely and very noticeably busty not that she wasn’t before , but now they looked extra large for her frame.  
“Holy sh…, I must be an f cup now they are enormous”  
“Im sorry Tiffani, it must be because you took my seed inside them”  
“What are you sorry for Zal?”  
She grinned as her hands cupped under each breast and took a sample of their weight making her beam with delight as she sampled their new girth.  
“they look fabulous even bigger and sexier than before, your not really sorry are you Zal I mean you like what you’ve created huh?”  
With that question posed she tilted her struggling bra so it loomed those humungous pendulous breasts over him totally dominating his view from everything else with her curvy flesh. This not only stunned Zal with just how large they had become but also emphasized that they were barely contained by her bra which looked more like it sported quarter cups.  
“Your gonna need a new bra they are breathtaking”  
“I don’t want them any bigger than this so we had best be careful from now on or Ill be suffering from back ache just to walk with them”  
“You meant to do this didn’t you Tiffani you wanted them larger?”  
Her face admitted he was right.  
“I always fancied being exceptionally busty”  
“You were before my goddess now you are even more impressive”  
“and more room to carry a man in comfort eh?”  
She wobbled her breasts above him and then covered herself up and it was clear that her white sweater was also bursting with the size of its two new occupants.  
“looks like its not only new bra’s im gonna need”  
Tiffani laughed and smoothed her hands over her bust.  
  
For the next half an hour Zal settled on the table sitting on top of a book whilst he remotely interrogated his ship computer through his palm sized computer with its holographic interface glowing before his eyes.  
“what ya doing tiny I cant make out that little screen down there”  
“I think I know why we Tallions have such an effect on earth women, Ive scanned myself and everything that comes from my galaxy and I believe that its Raytron that is the catalyst.”  
”are you getting technical on me again tiny”  
He watched her eyes narrow in concentration  
“in my galaxy the sun that all the planets orbit gives out a trace of Raytron radiation in the light it emits, everything absorbs this harmless energy. We think of it as normal but Raytron seems to stimulate growth on this planet. You remember the com-crystal you carried for so long”  
“sure”  

##Part 13  
  
“well you said you suspended it between your breasts for months on your necklace , well even the effect from the com-crystals Raytron exposure has increased your breast size over time and it seems my seed is concentrated with Raytron”  
“and that’s why you make a big impact on me”  
“Talking to yourself Tiff?”  
“Corrina?”  
Tiffani swiveled around in the chair to see her tall friend enter.  
“Im talking to my little boyfriend, Corrina meet Zal , Zal here is a natural 6ft beauty”  
The look of astonishment was equal on both sides as Zal looked up from the table at a  
brunette who was simply stunning rivaling Tiffani with her clear skin and her startling green eyes. Her hair was long and silky and laid straight around her face with slight irregular curls upon its length. Her figure was slim and far less pronounced than Tiffani but she still had a healthy chest that made its presence known beneath the tight red vest top she sported. Her long legs were covered in a tight pair of white boot leg jeans that offered her midriff in plain view. Zal smiled up and just stood there enchanted by yet another pretty giantess.  
“oh my god he is real! And so very tiny”  
“He’s big where it counts”  
Tiffani laughed as she watched her best friend come to terms with meeting an alien.  
“You didn’t totally believe me did you, well here he is all two inches or less of him”  
“Im err pleased to meet you Zal im Corrina”  
She lowered a massive by comparison finger to Zal and he took the digit in his hands to shake it a gesture Tiffani had once told him earth people did when greeting a new acquaintance.  
“the pleasure is all mine giantess ”  
“Giantess, I suppose I am to you”  
She smiled at the label he placed on her.  
“this is incredible Tiff, absolutely incred….Tiff woah! Your tits look ready to explode , look how massive they are?”  
Shocked by the increased volume of her friends bust Corrina was totally distracted for a second she looked down in comparison to her more average c cup breasts and felt totally flat to the buxom blonde who sat there with a knowing grin across her face.  
“Courtesy of my little boyfriend Zal here but Ill explain that later and that’s not all”  
Tiffani stood up and Corrina gasped openly as her once shorter pal now looked her in the eye.  
“are you still wearing those stilts! , how big are the heels on those boots girl?”  
“Im over five foot nine now , not much shorter than you”  
Tiffani boasted and it was clear to she wasn’t lying.  
“It suits you girl, this guy certainly does have an amazing effect on you. Im not sure I can take all this in I need to sit down.”  
After twenty minutes of idle chatter Corrina had come to terms with the fact that all of this was reality.  
“So Zal, whats it like on your planet?”  
“Warm , tranquil and very boring”  
“But you’ve got cool technology right? I mean space ships and stuff?”  
“sure but nothing as exciting as the giant babes of Earth”  
There was smooth look from Zal as he flirted  
“Really? Are all the men so um little from your planet?”  
“Im 5ft 10 inches tall”  
Corrina looked down at Zal and burst into laughter joined by Tiffani who managed to stop herself long enough to add.  
“I forgot to tell you Corrina, didn’t you know that your over 200 feet tall?”  
They laughed some more at Zal’s expense and then Corrina settled in a chair before the table. Zal glanced across at the two incredibly beautiful giant women looming over him and felt like a prize exhibit at the beta 5 insectoid fair.  
“So what’s it like to be tiny on this planet Zal , I mean joking aside Tiff and I must look pretty enormous to you”  
“Im slowly getting used to it , it was a little overwhelming at first”  
He admitted and strolled casually across the table top towards Tiffani  
“there are a couple of things he still finds very overwhelming isn’t there Zal”  
Tiffani began in a sexy manor as she lowered her large chest resting her breasts on the table almost landing them on Zal as he stopped in his tracks inches before them. For Zal the noticeable thud of those heavy mounds covered in her tight white sweater was quite audible and the small tremor on the table enough to unsettle his feet.  
“a couple of very big , very sexy things”  
She finished with a large smile upon her red painted lips seeing how even more than before the magnitude of her breasts dwarfed her little boyfriend.  
“Oh Tiff your boobs are as big as houses to him! Ha! Guess being a little man does have its major benefits and those are major benefits! ha!”  
“Yeh, he is a bit of a boob man aren’t you Zal my little baby?”  
Tiffani curved a hand around the back of Zal and slid it behind him pushing him forward to be greeted by the softness of her sweater and inline with the recess between her breasts. He was enveloped by the white exterior of her top as she snuggled him in its warmth.  
“Tiff he won’t be able to breathe between those two you’ll smother him”  
Corrina smiled as the almost two inch form of Zal was lost from sight in the material.  
“He loves it believe me”  
“Hey you two haven’t well you know?”  
A raised eyebrow and expression from Corrina gave a clue to her question and Tiffani returned a slight embarrassed face when she admitted.  
”well he is my little pocket sized boyfriend , but we’ve only had some fun so far experimenting”  
“Oooh you are a naughty girl Tiff. What was it like? I cant imagine it , with a guy this tiny I mean it must be like making out with one of my brothers little action figures”  
“Well lets just say it’s the little actions that count”  
The two girls entered into some girly chatter as Zal was released once more.  
“Can I hold him?”  
“Hey Im am here girls”  
Zal frowned with Corrina asking permission over him like some pet belonging to her friend.  
“Of course you are baby, Corrina would just like to pick you up in her hand is that ok with you?”  
“I guess so if your gentle ”  
“I can be very gentle”  
She replied and then a hand with long red painted finger nails searched down on the table to lift him. The sensation of being lifted in a hand was becoming all to familiar for Zal as another set of mammoth finger circled him and then closed in around him. Seconds later like a giant clam releasing those fingers curled out and left him on the surface of a giant palm held opposite ’s inquisitive eyes.  
“wow this is amazing, you are so small”  
“and you are gigantic”  
Zal smiled and was moved this way and that as she inspected him from all sides.  
“Tiffani he is a little hotty, if you were only six feet taller I’d be making a play for you myself tiny”  
“He’s all mine , my little pocket boyfriend from outerspace”  
The two friends giggled again and it was then that one of the electronic devices in Zal’s flight suit began to bleep.  
“What the?”  
Zal reached into the belt at his waist retrieving a small palm sized device.  
”No way!”  
“Zal what is it?”  
Tiffani looked at his concerned face.  
“Pirates”  
“Pirates? What do you mean?”  
“My ships signaling me its picking up an incoming vessel and the signature is a remote pirate scout”  
“Whats he going on about Tiff more little aliens coming here?”  
“yeh what gives Zal who are these Pirates?”  
“They are bad news that’s what. Tiffani I have to get back to my ship pronto and I um don’t have any transport”  
“I think he needs a lift Tiff”  
“Well then I guess that’s where a giant girlfriend comes in handy now doesn’t it”  
“Can I come ? I mean ive never seen a real space ship before”  
Corrina turned to her friend  
“Ive no objection, how about you Zal?”  
“fine by me. But we haven’t long we need to get going now”  
“can I carry Zal?”  
Zal looked at the eager eyes of his girlfriends best pal as she still held him.  
“why not if you look after him, alright with you tiny?”  
“well err”  
“Of course it is eh Zal? Another giant babe handling you. He’ll fit nicely in my Jeans here”  
Before Zal could offer his acceptance he was lowered into a tight front pocket of ’s white jeans, as she stood up Tiffani could see the small bulge he made in the otherwise figure hugging material. Zal panicked a little he was held immobile as if a vice had clamped down on him and he was in total darkness.  
“ your gonna crush him in there those jeans look like you had them painted on he cant stay in there”  
“I err didn’t think, sorry Im not used to being a giant woman”  
Zal was lifted free and thankful for it as Corrina dangled him between two fingers.  
“sorry little guy Im not into the baggy jeans scene if a girls got a figure I believe in showing it”  
“come on we have to get going , just put him down the front of your top I did”  
Tiffani walked over to her friend who was a little stunned at the statement and simply took charge of the situation.  
”Look give him here”  
Passed to another set of giant fingers Zal found himself hovering above the more modest but still enormous cleavage of Corrina’s displayed by her vibrant red vest top.  
“Undo your top buttons”  
Tiffani commanded and her friend slowly complied revealing a nice fleshy valley below Zals feet as the v neck of her top opened generously up.  
“I hope your wearing a bra girl”  
Tiffani laughed as she lowered her boyfriends tiny form inside the ample cleavage of her friend.  
“this tickles”  
She laughed as Zal slipped down between her breasts and as she laughed they buffeted him from either side with their softness as he settled deep down and in the centre of them. Peering down into her bra Corrina presented a massive grin of delight.  
“Oh this is priceless just look at him in there, ive never felt so busty before. I like the feel of you in there , you can climb around inside my bra if you’d like to, ha!”  
”hey don’t get any ideas in there Zal you’re my little man not hers and besides your tits are a little small for him he likes them house sized not garden shed”  
Tiffani and Corrina both burst into laughter at their banter and walked off out of the library. Jostled around Zal figured he didn’t know what a garden shed was but what surrounded him on each side presently was plenty big enough to be impressive and made him feel very small to know each of these women could deposit him so easily on their person and carry him this way. But he had little time to enjoy his position he was worried about facing the Pirates. The girls grabbed a bus and managed to sit on the top deck away from other people.  
“Hows my little man doing? your not suffocating him in that little bra of yours are you?”  
Tiffani light heartedly peeked at her friends top which showed no outward clue of the little passenger hitching a lift and snuggled in the bra below.  
“He isn’t moving a lot, probably scared his giant girlfriends going to tell him off if he enjoys himself in my top too much”  
Corrina undid two buttons and Zal pushed himself up with his arms until his face was peeking out of the centre of v neck top.  
“girls this isn’t time for having fun its serious that Pirate scout is less than half an hour from my ship and closing”  
The girls realised he was sincere and worried  
“So what is one of these Pirate’s?”  
Tiffani asked imagining all sorts of weird and wonderful alien creatures.  
“The Space Pirate’s are a group of mis-fits in the known galaxies who prey on traders such as I, raiding us in transit and stealing our cargo for their own gain. They operate from the Nova star cluster and send automated scouts to track our ion trails in remote regions of space like this. If this scout reaches my ship before us it will slice a hole in my hull for a look whether im carrying cargo or not and that will disabled my ship breeching its structural integrity for flight and that’s if they don’t take out my engines anyway”  
“Well I understood some of that , basically they are the bad guys and they are after what you may carry in your ship and we’ve got to stop them”  
“No Tiffani not we , me I cant endanger you girls this is my affair”  
Five minutes later the trio arrived at Zal’s craft and he dis engaged the camouflage system so it was visible.  
“Oh how cool a little space ship”  
Corrina knelt down at the side of Zal’s ship and ran her hand along its body surface.  
”this has actually travelled in space its fantastic but so tiny”  
  
##Part 14  
  
“I think im going to have to bring a Definian Astro Liner to impress you girls next time but even that’s wouldn’t be as tall as you both. Anyway looking at this readout the scout will be here immanently so its time for you girls to keep your distance, can you put me down by my ship please?”  
“What do you think Tiff , Idd say he would be far safer in my bra here and between these than down there”  
Zal tried to climb out of her top but slipped back down in her cleavage and the girls heard his muffled cries to let him out.  
“I don’t like the idea of him facing these Pirate things alone surely us girls can help I mean we are giants to him so his enemies might be little as well”  
Tiffani pondered  
“but he does seem a little annoyed in there listen to him. Perhaps we should let him stand his ground”  
With this decided Zal was lifted free of Corrina’s top and placed on the ground before his ship. Looking up the towering columns of the two giantesses legs he shouted.  
“Ladies please take cover over there behind that huge wall I need to prepare”  
Reluctant the girls decided to comply and moved off several metres away behind a half demolished brick wall and peered through the gaps in the decayed brick work.  
Zal boarded his ship and made his way to the cockpit.  
“Computer defence screens at maximum”  
“complying level 7 initiated”  
The ship hummed as an invisible shield rose around it placing it within a cocoon of protection. His craft didn’t offer any other offence capabilities to defend itself with it was purely a traders vessel not designed for combat. He pressed a hand against a panel at the rear of the cockpit and it revealed two hand held energy weapons. Zal took one of the rifles and checked its power bank. It was half charged but there was no time to address this.  
Walking out of the ship he sealed it up and ran through the energy shield which registered his bio signature allowing him such passage and he took up a strategic position next to some rocks nearby.  
“Look at him he’s got a little gun , he’s very brave”  
Tiffani observed from the distance  
“look Tiff up in the air , over there”  
A glowing triangle of light hovered down from the sky and settled on the ground very close in proximity to Zal’s space ship. Fascinated the two girls watched it split into two pieces and those pieces transformed into what looked like 2 identical mechanical men each less than a foot tall but with no legs upon which to move instead they had tank like tracks. They looked fearsome with a number of savage looking cutting and grabbing devices protruding from their main bodies. Zal’s heart beat increased it wasn’t the first time he had faced a Pirate scout and he knew if he disposed of these two automated drones usually none would follow as the pirates would limit the possibility of great losses if it was a hostile reception. Worst case would be that one survived and reached orbit in order to send a signal to its base and call for support units because it had identified a sizeable bounty to recover. He checked his rifle’s under slung proton launcher and cocked it ready for his encounter. The armour on the pirates scouts was thick and only a well placed hit with a proton blast would penetrate them. He heard one of the drones approaching its metal tracks grated on the terrain spitting out small fragments of rubble that they pulverised beneath them. He felt the adrenalin surge through his body he couldn’t allow it to get closer and to use its cutting heads to push into his hull and damage his ship.  
“Tiff look that ones right by Zal”  
Corrina whispered afraid for him. The two girls looked on anxiously as Zal went into action. He dived out of cover and before the path of the drone and instantly the automaton reacted by training some weapons at the small foe be. Zal fired a folly of Proton blasts at the base of the tracks and leaped from his position as the drone returned fire chopping great trenches in the terrain around him with its lasers. In a very dramatic somersault Zal avoided the fire and heard his shots hit home with a tremendous impact.  
The drone was immobilised as its tracks sheered off on one side smoking violently as a ball of fire consumed them. But it did little to stop the drone on its offensive. It targeted Zal’s new position and a large flame projected out from one of its many arms lighting up the vegetation that Zal had sought cover within and frazzling it to the ground. His lightening reactions allowed him to anticipate this move and to again launch himself clear , he landed hard on the ground but performed a rolling maneuver with his athletic prowess pushed to the limit managing to let off a shot in mid motion. This superb shot hit the drone upon its visual scanner the only real vulnerable part. An explosion filled the air raining debris from the sky as its head piece upon which the visual scanner was mounted was blown clear off the body. This drone was destroyed. The girls watched impressed at this scene but Tiffani was scared for Zal as she witnessed the other drone closing behind him as he recovered to his feet unaware until it was too late. The monstrous drone loomed down over Zal and swiftly extended a mechanical cutter with a savage blade that barely missed Zal’s body but connected with his rifles barrel slicing it in half and destroying it in the process. Having no choice but to run he fled but was confronted by a barrier in the form of a concrete block that was in reality only 6 inches tall but to Zal it was far too high to scale its sheer face. He backed up to the wall to see the drone bearing down upon him and he feared the worst.  
“Pick on someone your own size, well not quite”  
Came a booming cry from above and directly behind the drone forcing its attention away from Zal. It rotated its central body a full one eighty degrees to see a pair of huge towering black leather boots stomping towards it and trembling the ground as Tiffani sped to Zal’s aid. The drone even though it had no emotion seemed to pause in disbelief as the giantess confronted it.  
“kiss my boots tin can!”  
She barked aggressively as her foot raised a huge dark sole high above the drone and then slammed it down hard onto its body. An almighty crunching sound of the metal buckling beneath such vast weight rumbled over Zal as he saw the drone compress to half its original size as its now deformed body folded flatter and flatter spilling components out of its sides until all that was left was the collapsed tracks and platform.  
It was astonishing for Zal to behold the simple way she dealt with this adversary crushing him into the terrain under her boot it made him respect her size more than ever and if he was honest it made him more nervous of his girlfriends power. Tiffani reached down and picked up the broken remains holding it as her friend came out from hiding.  
“that was easy”  
She remarked  
“guess they aren’t designed to tangle with a 200 foot blonde”  
Laughing she tossed the drone aside into the bush and knelt down to see Zal.  
“good job im on your side eh little man?”  
“Ill say”  
“perhaps next time you’ll let your big girlfriend fight your battles for you huh?”  
”Yeh”  
He answered feeling very inadequate stood down at her feet noticing the slight scoring marks on her high heels made from crushing the drone.  
“He was brave though Tiff I mean to him that was a big robot thingy and pretty nasty”  
“Not to us though, it was about as frightening as a little bull terrier”  
They laughed and looked down at Zal who was wandering back to his ship.  
“need a lift?”  
Tiffani questioned but didn’t wait for a reply as her hand swooped down over Zal plucking him into the air and carrying him over to his ship with his legs dangling.  
This was something he was struggling to get used to , those two giantess being able to pick him up without warning , carrying him when ever and where ever they desired. Some parts he loved but some parts made him feel so weak and fragile in their presence.  
“thanks”  
He shouted up as the large hand moved away and he walked back into his ship to disengage the shield. Returning into view of his giant companions from the boarding ramp he shouted up.  
“No sign of any other scouts I think we are clear for now”  
They beamed smiles down pleased with the situation.  
“Tiffani can I have your mothers chain now please”  
“Oh I nearly forgot”  
She reached into her skirt pocket and lowered down the chain.  
“can you push it under the rear of my ship? Its rather heavy”  
”No problem”  
She obliged and the necklace was positioned under his ship.  
“computer open aft bay doors and activate retrieval beams lock on to trelan  
And take it aboard”  
“complying”  
In seconds a hatch opened and in an orange haze the chain was sucked into the ships interior.  
“Cargo aboard , awaiting instructions”  
The computers voice announced  
“assign all maintenance bots to utilise the trelan and fashion the replacement reflector plates”  
“caution trelan source material is not pure”  
“agreed computer but will it work”  
“please clarify the inquiry”  
Zal shook his head sometimes computers seems so advanced other times he felt like he was dealing with a child  
“computer analyse the trelan and assess probability for sufficient shielding properties”  
“92% compatible”  
“That’s good enough for me , continue with maintenance bot assignment”  
“complying”  
“computer estimate timescale for repair cycle”  
“24hrs, 16minutes, 32 seconds”  
“well ladies my ship repairs are underway I guess I should stay here and supervise.”  
“Oh no you don’t mister its my birthday tomorrow and we have some partying to do”  
Tiffani grinned  
“Yeh that’s right were going clubbing and your coming with us big girls little man”  
Corrina joined in and a clasped a hand around Zal lifted him from the boarding ramp.  
“computer seal ship , activate camouflage systems”  
He bellowed as he was raised upwards at a rapid rate and the ship complied.  
“woah, hang on don’t I get a choice in this?”  
Zal found himself opposite the two sets of green eyes staring at him. One his giant girlfriends the other her friend but both equally alluring and beautiful.  
“Does he get a choice Tiff?”  
Corrina asked playfully.  
“well let me ask him”  
Tiffani walked up to her friends hand that displayed her tiny lover and she moved her large full lips very close to him so he could feel the warm breathe behind her every word as she whispered with those lips almost touching him.  
“you can stay but you’ll miss being with me tonight and you’ll miss seeing me in my sexiest of outfits tomorrow night”  
What could he say he was already feeling the onset of the burning and her words were enticing and so seductive.  
“Oh Tiffani”  
He conceded and she knew he was unable to resist.  
“then that’s settled, so now you two we are off college early today and the afternoon is young, shall we go to Ballers lagoon?”  
Corrina agreed.  
“you’ll love this zal”  
Tiffani assured him as she took him from her friend and slipped him inside her skirt pocket.  
The walk didn’t seem long and before ten minutes Zal was in her hand and could see both girls had settled down sat in the sunshine aside a huge mass of clear water.  
“an ocean?”  
“more of a man made lake cut into the rock when the old factory used to be here Zal its pretty small well to us anyway, but the water is fine its from a natural well that was diverted nearby I think only , me and a few select friends know of it.”  
“a secret eh?”  
“You could say that. We like the privacy don’t we Corrina , especially on days like this when its hot and Corrina and I want some time alone”  
Setting him down on the top of a tree stump Tiffani with a smile on her face looked across to her friend and winked. Then the most breathtaking show was put on for Zal one he wouldn’t forget. Corrina and Tiffani stood by next to each other side by side and then they both knelt down to face each other aware of the audience below. Then he watched as Tiffani reached across to her friend and began to undress her starting with the vest top slowly releasing button after button. Her pert breasts in a black bra pushed through in side profile to Zal looking as big as ever and Tiffani’s hand brushed the side of one cup then held its weight for a second with a smile. Then delicately she help to remove the red top. Never had Zal seen two girls behave in such a manor was there an attraction between them? Now wearing her bra and tight white jeans Corrina moved closer to her friend and pulled her sweater up inching it over her considerable breasts until the struggling bra could be spotted straining to retain the womanly charms within. The action of stroking the breast was returned only Corrina was running her fingers around the curves of Tiffani until she discovered the catch and released it. Suddenly the massive bra came free and playfully Corrina didn’t offer Zal a glimpse as she lowered the molded cup to cover him and it sat upright like a dome over his head. Zal ran to the side and pushed but did little to shift the material that held its shape so well. He strained to lift the edge and just managed to heaved it over himself as it was very awkward for such a small man but now he once more had and unrestricted view of …his girlfriends skirt rising way above as she now faced the tree stump. His eyes traveled its length and higher still searching across the flat expanse of a gorgeous trim stomach until he saw the impressive womanly swells that hung teasingly in the air above pointing out with her huge nipples. A wonderful mane of blonde locks spilled over those breasts partly obscuring them and then he noticed two additional hands not belonging to Tiffani beginning to edge long fingers around the curve of those breasts from behind. The outstretched fingers failed to cup much more than a quarter of their mass but began stroking the nipples into a swelling glory. Tiffani sighed and Zal found this display of women sharing their sexual affection strangely arousing. He was hard and his hardness desired to see more of the two girls as they played so openly above him. Corrina’s hand slid from the breasts and went south circling the band at the top of Tiffani’s skirt until a button and zipper fell prey to them and the skirt slipped gracefully down her silky thighs to reveal  
a small pair of white lace panties.  
“enjoying the show Zal?”  
Sighed Tiffani as she lowered down, dangling her breast just for a second so they blotted out the sky to Zal. Raising up once more she stood tall and Zal looked in wonder as he appreciated the enormity of her bare legs soaring above into the tiny yet giant panties now far above him. A giant head of dark hair curled around from behind to settle a pair of full lips upon another set as the girls kissed passionately. Tiffani motioned her friend to kneel and she placed her hands on her shoulders as Corrina tenderly kissed down the length of her belly and then hooked her red nails into the hip straps of the lacy panties pausing to glance across at Zal to ensure he was captivated.  
“I think we are leaving someone out of the action Tiff”  
Tiffani grinned in a sexy manor.  
“What a great idea care to join us Zal?”  
He nodded speechless and Corrina diverted her hands to pick him up.  
“I , have never witnessed women sharing each other on my planet”  
“we aren’t on your planet now little one, Tiff and I have a special relationship we like guys but we also like to have fun ourselves because no one knows a woman’s body like another woman”  
  
##Part 15  
  
The girls explained but to Zal this was an alien concept yet one he found strangely arousing to witness and now he was going to become part of this fun as she termed it.  
“ I think it would be very sexy if you put little Zal in my knickers so he can experience first hand how enormous his girlfriend really is to him”  
“You little minx Tiff , with pleasure. But to truly feel the sensations I think a little someone should strip in my hand first don’t you?”  
Zal wasn’t going to argue he could see below over the side of Corrina’s palm his girlfriends gorgeous body stretching down. He lustfully gazed at the pretty white underwear that only barely covered her womanhood and he knew he would be entering them very shortly going under that lacy barrier to the promised land.  
Without hesitation he removed his flight suit stripping to his own under garments and Corrina’s spare hand moved in a large finger to brush his clothes away letting them fall below.  
“and your underwear tiny , I want to see you strip totally naked in my hand”  
Corrina was getting excited by the sound of her voice. For Zal this was a very different feeling to be so small and on show before two hungry females of impossible proportions he hoped that they would be gentle with him as right now looking at the half naked giantesses he felt vulnerable.  
“that’s better I can see your little rod now, Tiff its so cute look how small it is…my finger nails are longer”  
“im big for a tallion”  
Zal tried hit back with a manly response to gain his confidence back but he knew she was right , even if his love equipment quadrupled in size it would do nothing to impress these giant girls.  
“Im sure you are, ha!”  
“don’t tease him he is big for his size aren’t you my baby”  
“Yeh I bet when he’s really hard you can almost break a centimeter cant you Zal?”  
Zal looked up at as she held him in her palm opposite her bra covered breasts he wanted to provide a snappy retort but words failed him as suddenly Corrina gently rubbed a giant finger between his legs and right up them, parting them with its thickness. He was almost straddling her finger as she eased the tip under his two jewels.  
“Im only teasing you tiny because I wish I was able to go where your about to go”  
She wiggled her finger and then moved it away to hover him above the edge of Tiffani’s lacy underwear. Pulling the underwear out Zal peered over the fingers that suspended him and looked into the inviting depths of the pretty panties below. As a natural blonde he spied a neatly trimmed pathway of hair that outlined the giant hungry lips that awaited him.  
“In you go tiny, inside your girlfriends giant sexy underwear”  
Corrina let him gently fall from the tips of her fingers and Zal dropped several feet until the soft material caught him and guided him to the bottom of the panties to face his girlfriend enormous sex. He saw the material above snap shut and he was immersed into the dim light offered through the holes in the lace.  
Zal wiggled down until he lined up perfectly with her giant lips each taller than he was. The material pressed against his back and restricted his movement some what and he found this forced his body to rub up against the now very moist love entrance. There was only one description for the smell that penetrated his nostrils now and that was intoxicating and all absorbing as he was breathing it in.  
“ooh I can feel him rubbing against me its wonderful…”  
The booming voice of an excited Tiffani fell on Zal’s ears as he positioned himself to begin playing with her. Reaching forward he lost his arms deep inside as he pushed through the outer folds of her skin and entered into the hot wetness beyond. It was obvious to Zal that he could probably enter her completely and this was an exciting prospect but at the same time a scary thought as he realized how truly small he was to every earth girl. Tiffani began to respond to his contact it was getting her very hot and she couldn’t believe someone so tiny could offer her so much pleasure. In the throws of her enjoyment Zal felt exterior pressure on his back a force that he couldn’t object to if he tried. It was several of her fingers pressing him in deeper from behind , urging him to slip his body between the giant hungry lips that seemed now to be kissing him across his entire torso.  
“I want you Zal , all of you. Im so big so huge , your mine!”  
Tiffani was beyond aroused by now , her man almost inside her and the feeling of him wriggling on the verge of being lost inside her wetness was incredible she bellowed almost squeals of her enjoyment as her fingers buried him into the hot giant cave. Zal felt himself moving deeper the air becoming thin and the heat surrounding him was like an oven as hot love fluids of her lubrication covered him from head to toe. He closed his eyes and concentrated on offering Tiffani new sensations by moving around vigorously in the hot fleshy internal walls that encased him. Zal felt like he was being kissed by hot giant lips that touched down upon every part of his naked body as he moved deeper in her love canal and he burst his load despite the fact that part of him was beginning to become alarmed at the stifling heat and lack of air. Meanwhile Tiffani had also reached her climax and suddenly became very aware of Zal who was completely inside her and unable to remove himself without assistance. In a slight panic she pulled down her panties half way upon her thighs and reached inside herself with her fingers searching for Zal’s tiny frame. She found his feet and slipped him out between her lips until her spare hand caught him. He was gasping for breathe for a couple of seconds and spluttering from the gooey film that clung to his skin. Tiffani smiled down he looked so helpless in her palm as he recovered from making love to a giantess.  
“you are one precious wonderful sexy little man Zal , ive never cum like that before”  
“You were in orbit girl even I haven’t had that effect on you”  
Corrina was obviously impressed that for someone so insignificant he made such an impact on Tiffani but as Zal lay there in her palm he felt as tall as the two giantesses for just that moment as they discussed his sexual prowess.  
“looks like your full of surprises pip squeak”  
Corrina lifted him up from her friends hand and inspected his drenched exterior.  
“lets see if I can clean you up , you should be quite tasty with your Tiffani flavouring”  
Zal could only watch as Corrina’s head tilted back and her enormous mouth opened wider than a star cruisers escape hatch and displayed her pearly white teeth. If he hadn’t been so tired after his session with Tiffani he may have struggled but he knew she meant him no harm. In seconds he was laying along her tongue and licked and sucked like a sweet until he was pulled smoothly between Corrina’s plump lips as they closed down on him like a pair of rollers making sure every trace of Tiffani’s inner juices had been removed.  
“Boy you did taste good, I was tempted to gobble you up whole”  
It was a joke but her words even in jest left Zal with an uncomfortable vision that she could have done just that.  
“thank you goddess ”  
He smiled up as she handed him back to Tiffani.  
“Its time to do what we came here for , right Tiff , lets skinny dip!?”  
“Im game, and I think this little boyfriend of mine can ride on one of these”  
Zal was taken to her nipple , it was now such a size since her bust had increased before that he could easily straddle it with his legs much to his amazement. He held on with both hands keeping his balance on the nipple as he stared out to see the tremendous drop below. He felt really high up and her breast stuck out so far from her body he could barely catch any glimpses of her feet and legs moving way below.  
“that’s cute he’s so tiny on your nipple I wish mine were as big”  
Corrina looked down at Zal overshadowed by the enormous breast behind him when suddenly he seemed to get smaller? Zal noticed it too as the nipple began to enlarge slowly beneath him! But he wasn’t shrinking it was Tiffani who was attaining more height as the power within Zal’s fluid left its mark.  
“Oh god im growing again! I forgot about Zal getting excited inside me , look im getting taller!”  
In seconds her body rose the 3 inches that separated the two friends.  
“look im six foot tall!”  
She beamed impressed that she was sharing eye contact with Corrina but she didn’t stop there her height continued to increase.  
“Tiff your still growing , your taller than me!”  
Zal saw his view of Corrina rise from under her bust until he could see her cleavage slightly below and finally Tiffani ceased growing and held a very lofty new stature.  
“Hello shorty , what’s the weather like down there ?”  
Tiffani said as she was totally absorbed with the presence she commanded.  
“I look fabulous look how long my legs are , Corrina ive got several inches on yours and yours I used to think of as long! Im one hell of a leggy babe now”  
She removed her underwear from her thighs and twirled in her naked glory. Zal gripped the thickness of her nipple with all his might as she did so and preyed she would stop. Tiffani saw his dilemma and stopped allowing her breasts to bob gently to a halt.  
“oops sorry tiny I nearly forgot about you then”  
“Tiff, how the hell are you going to explain this, you going to be taller than every guy in college! Actually every guy I know full stop!”  
“yeh I err guess we’ll have to work on that one wont we?”  
She laughed reveling in her moment and not wanting to come down off the high she was feeling.  
“Im going to buy some really short skirts to show these off, from now on my legs will be on display all the time! Hey perhaps I can wear some of your clothes now ”  
“I don’t think you’re my size your definitely leggier and super voluptuous”  
Corrina glanced enviously at the difference between them but before the conversation continued Tiffani pulled her friend by the hand towards the invitingly clear water. Corrina discarded the rest of her clothes and they both splashed into the water naked as the day they were born. In seconds Zal was soaking as the water rose up to Tiffani’s breasts allowing his legs to enter it before she began to swim. Suddenly with the prospect of huge waves about to cascade over him as more of her breast began to submerge he clambered off the nipple leaping for her dangling blonde hair and hoisted himself to relative safety as Tiffani began to move gracefully through the water. She smiled noticing he was climbing her thick locks like a rope until he made it to the top of her blonde crown and settled there feeling a little unsafe. The two girls frolicked naked in the water having fun they had been there time and time before and felt at home. At one stage Zal fell off a result of Corrina blasting a tidal wave over Tiffani and he crashed into the water below. To him the expanse of the man made pool might as well have been a huge lake as the shore line was miles away. The two giantesses continued to splash and play around which made for quite a sight as Zal treaded water and observed them from afar. When they noticed he was missing they paused with their green eyes scanning the water in a semi panicked state. Tiffani spotted him first several metres away from her current position due to the ripples sent out by their activities that had carried him away. Like the stranded victim of a ship wreck he bobbed along in the water waiting to be rescued. Zal waved his arms and Tiffani grinned feeling like she was a life guard about to save this little man. She winked at Corrina and dived under the water in his direction. The ominous vision of her gargantuan form cutting through the waters below like a submarine was unnerving for someone so small. In seconds the water around him began to quake and the startling emergence from under the depths of a huge beautiful face was breathtaking as Tiffani broke the surface. Slowly she rose higher until Zal was bobbing around in the water almost between the large gap of her boat sized breasts half submerged yet still so substantial in their presence. But then the turbulence her approach made in the water sent Zal helplessly carried away upon a wave , well in reality a large ripple and Tiffani reached out a hand and simply plucked him up from the water.  
“Out of your depth tiny? Need a lift?”  
“thanks”  
Zal felt pathetic as she held him in her fingers and deposited him on top of her shoulder. Holding tight to some wet blonde hair strands he waited as she swam for shore followed by Corrina. In the heat of the afternoon sun they lay there drying off still naked. Zal didn’t care to much for heat and opted to shelter in the shadow of Tiffani’s leather boots as they stood like great monuments above him. He reflected on what had just occurred , not his experiences in the water but the sensual contact between two giant females that he had witnessed it certainly was a remarkable planet.  
Later when early evening began to fall the trio returned on foot towards Tiffani’s house.  
Tiffani looked quite a sight her feet cramped uncomfortably in her boots which had stretched beyond all design and her long skirt was desperately tight around her waist and had risen up her much longer legs. Her top was painfully thin and stretched so the material was at breaking point over her bust. Her mid rift was now partially exposed as the top failed to meet her new statistics. Corrina smiled up at her now taller pal.  
“Listen guys Ive gotta split but Tiff Ill see you in class tomorrow and maybe you little one?”  
She looked down at Zal who was riding upon Tiffani’s shoulder for the journey.  
“I look forward to seeing more of you ”  
He smiled up at the giantess as she winked at him in return.  
“Oh I think tomorrow I can arrange that eh Tiff?”  
The girls giggled and parted with small peck like kisses. Upon returning home Tiffani took Zal straight to her room and set him down at the base of her wardrobe amongst a vast collection of shoes. For Zal entering the house once more made him recall his encounter with her mother which was something he didn’t wish to repeat. As luck would have it Tiffani was on the case to address these fears.  
“Zal , baby Im going to leave you here to hide amongst my shoes where you are safe whilst I deal with my mother ok?”  
“sure, good luck”  
Zal felt the rumbles of Tiffani’s footsteps as she walked away leaving him in a world comprising of huge women’s shoes and boots , some even taller than his space craft.  
He climbed up upon the toe section of a vibrant red court shoe which was simply enormous. Walking upon the creased leather surface he peered down into the recess where his giant girlfriend would slip her foot. It was fascinating for Zal to even contemplate that a living being could wear this and beyond everything it more than emphasized how enormous Tiffani was. Dropping down into the shoe some 5 or so feet he looked at the steep slope of the base rising above him. The heel on the shoe must have projected it some fifteen or so feet high to his appreciation which made it appear like a slide built for a childs amusement. It was far more dramatic an interior than the shoe he had explored before given its exceedingly tall heel. As he explored inside his girlfriends shoe Tiffani had discovered her mother in the garden knelt down tending to some weeds.  
“Mum!”  
Tiffani began in an abrupt fashion but her mother didn’t bother to turn and face her and instead continued to toil with the flower bed before her.  
“Oh Tiff there you are I have been meaning to speak…”  
“stow it mother im not in the mood to listen to you…I want an explanation about Zal”  
“who?”  
Her mother pretended not to be triggered by the name further raising the anger of her daughter.  
“Zal, my boyfriend remember? My little boyfriend who you tried to abduct and have your way with”  
“So it was you who rescued him from big bad mummy’s clutches was it? You disappoint me Tiff it’s a shame you don’t realise what you have there with that toy but then again I think you do”  
Turning to see her now toweringly tall daughter Sandy smiled  
“I see your not quite the shrimp you used be…. and even standing up to your own mother , there’s hope for you yet young lady”  
“Whats got into you mother , you never used to be like this”  
“Im learning not to be used by men anymore and to use them instead”  
“what does that mean?”  
“Never mind”  
A small silence fell between them and then slowly Sandy stood up to confront her daughter and noticed she was for the first time in her life shorter than her despite her recent gain.  
“I see you’ve really been enjoying that little man of yours”  
“I love him and he consents to being with me unlike you, I cant believe you forced yourself on him for your own gains”  
  
##Part 16  
  
“Tiffani we all have our needs I just desired to be taller I can face my troubles with a lot more confidence like this”  
“what troubles? What gives you the right to take my man and use him anyway? You knew he was mine”  
“Whats the odds eh Tiffani ? Two tiny men from outer space finding us both , it has to be fate. Im sorry if I hurt your feelings but I have needs and couldn’t resist the opportunity when it presented itself”  
There was a slight smile from Sandy which Tiffani frowned at but she could see there was no getting through to her mother whose mind was disturbed by something and she was very out of character.  
“I can see you don’t regret anything so there’s little point to continue this conversation mother”  
“Tiffani?”  
Sandy watched her daughter walk away  
“Oh and stay away from Zal”  
Tiffani shouted looking back and over her shoulder as she walked off bemused by the strange manor in which her mother conducted herself. She knew something was up but couldn’t put her finger on what. Whatever it was her mother seemed changed by it.  
Zal meantime was bored of the shoe’s interior and laid back on the incline of the internal slope resting. Tiffani entered the room in a temper and through herself down on her bed.  
“Tiffani!”  
A tiny call came from her wardrobe and she snapped out of her temper in an instant realising she had walked straight past her tiny boyfriends location in her mood. She walked over and knelt down to see him relaxed in one of her shoes.  
“Wow my shoes must look like big boats to you, you look a little lost inside it”  
“definitely roomy”  
He grinned as a huge set of fingers descended around him and Tiffani picked him up. They spent the next hour discussing her mother and she tried to set Zal at ease about being in the same house as her. Eventually he resided himself to the fact that his protector was his beautiful giantess girlfriend and he needed to stay very close to her from now on. Tiffani had taken some food to her room and ate heartily as Zal watched on from the pillow of her bed.  
“You know the first thing im going to do after I finish this Zal?”  
She half mumbled through a sandwich  
“attend to my physical needs”  
His face lit up with anticipation he could feel his growing need to be satisfied once more.  
“well maybe if you’re a good little boy”  
She offered a sexy pout his way and then continued  
“Im going to measure myself and see how impressive my stats are now”  
“I can see how impressive they are from down here”  
Zal’s one track mind was beginning to dominate his every thought as he felt the Tallion urge to off load his seed.  
“I can see some attention to you wont wait , I still feel satisfied from earlier and your ready to go again?”  
Putting her sandwich aside for a few seconds she picked Zal up and helped to strip off his clothes.  
“Tell you what my sex starved little man im going to lay down on this bed and put you right up high here on my big boobs and I want to watch you play with yourself as you dream of me”  
In a matter of seconds Zal was whisked up in the air with her extended arm and as he poked his head out of her fist he looked way down to see those enormous breasts bared as she pulled up her top to expose them. When their wobbling mass had settled his feet touched down on the bumpy and warm flesh of her areola, Since his last encounter with her bare nipple it had grown significantly.  
“This is gigantic I mean it was big before enormous even but now…your boobs are staggering Im really feeling small right now”  
He walked around the giving surface keeping balance as he studied her nipple very aware of the large drop down into her cleavage below.  
“You do look even smaller up there”  
She giggled and he clasped his arms to her nipple to avoid falling as her chest rumbled.  
“hey easy does it my giantess I wouldn’t want to fall that’s a long drop for me”  
“You are so cute Zal are they really that high?”  
He didn’t answer but she could easily see to someone his size her boobs would be like large hills with a drop several times his height. She realised to him they were fantastic in size but she then thought about her proportions to an ordinary man and how top heavy she had become which made her suddenly very cautious.  
“Actually Zal im probably in the huge boob category with a normal guy these are dam big now I don’t think I really want them any larger you’d better let me know before you release and make them so big that Ill fall over when I walk.”  
Stimulated only visually by the giantess proportions he stood upon and the gorgeous bodyscape he soon found his trigger point much to the pleasure of Tiffani who recognised this and held him suspended over a huge paper tissue to contain his fluids.  
In the next hour Tiffani began to understand the reality of her new size more and more realising the consequences of becoming extremely tall.  
“Zal there is hardly any of my clothes that will fit me im gonna need an entire new everything.”  
She held up various skirts and dresses which all looked like they belonged to a younger more underdeveloped sister only she knew these where all her own.  
“Im sorry Tiffani it seems there is a curse to loving someone like me”  
“no sweetie its not your fault I was more than willing and I knew the consequences after the first time I wanted to be taller. I mean I do look pretty hot with these long legs and no girl I know has such an impressive figure as this. Im just gonna have to get used to being the leggiest and bustiest girl in town and that mother of mine can buy me some new clothes to compensate for her treatment of you. I think ill wear a lot of skirts from now on , no use covering these super long pins of mine don’t you think Zal and when we arrive at that club tomorrow im gonna be turning every bodies head”  
“turning heads?”  
Zal was lost with her use of words but innocently asked.  
“is it accepted on this planet when someone grows so rapidly and so dramatically?”  
“what do you mean?”  
Tiffani sat down on the bed causing Zal to fall into her bare thigh due to the depression her giant rear made in the covers. Climbing to his feet he managed to scale her thigh with an athletic flip.  
“well on this planet you told me you were 5ft 6 inches tall and now you must be measured at least 6ft 5 inches tall are people not going to be surprised by this transformation?”  
“holy **** I hadn’t really thought about that! Your right Zal, Ive been getting carried away with how tall and busty Ive become and haven’t thought about the consequences. Ive gained nearly 12 inches in height everyone’s gonna be asking questions”  
She paced the bedroom realising she couldn’t hide any of her stature as she thought out loud.  
“Even if I start wearing little two inch heels im going to tower over every guy at college , there’s not even one guy on the basketball team who’s as tall as this. Everyone is going to start wondering what’s happened to me this could be dangerous for you as well Zal , what if I get sent for examinations they might find traces of your alien dna or something?”  
“I don’t know what to say Tiffani but don’t worry about me I will be leaving this planet in a day or so when my ship is ready and we have celebrated your birthday , its what im leaving behind that bothers me more”  
Tiffani cried a few tears feeling stupid for not thinking of the consequences when she got carried away with Zal.  
“now I wish I was 250 feet tall to hug you to my chest”  
Zal offered and looked up at the giant but beautiful face laced with big tears rolling down it he felt helpless to comfort her as he was stranded on the bed surface.  
“Oh what have I done to myself Zal?”  
She picked him up in her hand and crushed him into the softness of her naked breasts.  
A muffled answer came from her cleavage but she didn’t hear. When finally she had calmed down Zal was held in her cupped hands as she sat on the bed, he could hardly see her face over her breasts but knew it was still sad.  
“Is there anything I can do Tiffani?”  
“No im sorry Zal im being stupid im old enough now that I have to deal with my problems , its not really the height thing. I actually like being this way it feels right and I want to get out there and feel confident and show off this body Ive got. I think it’s a combination of falling out with my mum and her weirdo behavior and all its getting to me a bit.”  
Zal wrapped his arms around her thumb and held it as if it was her waist comfortingly.  
“Im sure in a few days your mother and you will resolve things once im out of the way and not a temptation to her anymore and I suppose if your happy with your height why not just go to your physician and say you woke up like this? They’ll perform tests but im sure with your planets state of technology they wont have any idea what would be the cause and as long as your healthy my bet is that they’ll put it down as an unexplained phenomena. Just convince anyone else you know that you have no explanation and the medical teams on your planet are doing their best to find out”  
“You now something Zal?”  
She lifted her hands way up to her face and he watched her flesh race by as he was suddenly inches from her large lips.  
“for a guy who is less than 2 inches tall you’ve got a bigger brain than anyone I know”  
Zal was bathed in a huge wet kiss his words of comfort hit the right spot and Tiffani was feeling good once more.  
“Now mister time for bed and Im not going to put you in danger again so your sleeping with me tonight”  

##Part 17  
  
“is that um advisable?”  
He suddenly felt nervous of her mountainous body being so close to his.  
“don’t panic Zal, it’s a warm night so I wont need any covers….”  
Zal didn’t know what he was letting himself in for but didn’t have much choice with his giant girlfriend calling the shots. She took Zal to the shower with her and washed him in her hands which was bliss for Zal as he felt them smother his body in a cool cleaning gel before she gently washed it away. Perched on the shower soap holder behind a raging torrent of water he had a front row seat to watch a giantess bathe herself. Even though he had relieved himself he began to harden as he stood there and through the mist of steam he made out the huge beads of water splashing and rolling down every marvelous curve of Tiffani’s extraordinary gorgeous body. A little later Tiffani had noticed his member standing to attention as he sat on her bedside cabinet watching her dry her hair.  
“Not again? I should call you Viagra man”  
Tiffani laughed  
“Who?”  
“Never mind, its an earth joke meaning your always up down there”  
He looked between his legs at his proud offering but before he could comment she unexpectedly picked him up in one hand.  
“Im going to try something but be careful where you , well you know don’t get any of your juices on me ok?”  
”Um sure”  
Zal found two thick fingers and long finger nails on either side of his waist and he was facing away from Tiffani as she backed him towards her. Suddenly he felt a moist warm and pleasing sensation as something large and wet began to part his dangling legs making its passage between them. He looked down to see the huge tip of her tongue as it curled up under his balls and at the same time coated his inner thighs with hot saliva. He was practically sat on her tongue as the huge muscle delicately licked up at his excited length. It was all too much for Zal a pleasure he wasn’t expecting.  
“Tiff! Tiff! I, im gonna burst!”  
He said alarmed at his inability to hold back.  
Her tongue withdrew in an instant as he exploded in the air with his liquids falling some 70 or so feet to the bed clothes below. Turning him around a very confident Tiffani smiled lovingly at him.  
“I think im getting the hang of being a giantess”  
“Im never going to able to live with a Tallion female not after this”  
He smiled totally fulfilled.  
“Just wait till tomorrow Zal im only just getting warmed up with ideas of how to please you….now once I wipe this away like so its time for bed”  
Tiffani picked Zal up she could see he was exhausted also and in need of rest. She carefully placed him on the cabinet as she found a pair of silk panties to put on.  
“good job these have a lot of give”  
She commented as he watched the pink underwear fractionally cover her blonde bush. Laying down she stretched out on her bed noticing her feet fell over the edge.  
“Im gonna need a new bed”  
She half laughed and made herself comfortable.  
“and what about my sleeping arrangements?”  
Zal looked across at the mountainous blonde stretched out before him.  
“Ive just put your sleeping arrangements on , im sorry if pinks not your colour tiny”  
Without another word he was transferred in a huge hand and his legs and torso slipped into the top of her soft silk panties which acted like a blanket reaching up to his shoulders as she ensured his head poked free.  
“goodnight tiny”  
“Goodnight my goddess”  
He said backing his words with a kiss as he rolled on his side to sleep on top of her warm body. He heard the light click off and he fell asleep in the darkness feeling safe and protected like never before.  
That night Zal found himself dreaming. In part of the dream he was being carried in Tiffani’s huge hand in the darkness of the night and then soon found himself in the top of her knickers once more as she entered the bedroom. In the dream she whispered in a sultry voice urging him to make love to her.  
“Go deep little man , deep into my knickers and find my sexy paradise , make love to me little man , give yourself to me little one.”  
The dream was so vivid , it was dark still but he knew where he was. He turned his body and crawled beneath the smooth giving silk until his skin was tickled by the hairs that tickled him all over as he wriggled through them letting his nose guide the way to her giant sex. There was a loud yet quite contented moan of pleasure from the outside world  
as he entered the hot welcoming lips that parted welcomingly around him.  
“let my sexy giant pussy be your world little one, loose yourself in me”  
The muffled whisper of a giant seductive voice encouraged him and Zal was blissfully giving himself to pleasure his giant girlfriend. When he came he was suddenly alert and awake? He found himself wrapped in the hot fleshy darkness of Tiffani struggling for breath. Rapidly he climbed out and fortunately hadn’t gone that deep. His head pushed out parting the soft lips that shielded the outside world and he gulped in the hot but refreshing air from inside her panties. What had he done? He had deluded himself he was dreaming and made love to Tiffani again , he knew in seconds she would be bigger than ever! Climbing free of her love passage as it contracted and pulsed around him he called up from beneath the material  
“Tiffani what have we done baby?”  
There was no answer but she was on the move! He was held fast bouncing against her wetness as Tiffani was walking , going to bathroom he guessed. Light pierced through the white material around him as Zal began to see again. White material!!  
Zal looked around in shock. The smell of the huge sex all over him it wasn’t Tiffani’s he hadn’t realised until now! Light entered from above and between two large breasts way above Sandy peered deep into her underwear at the tiny frightened man.  
“Surprise guess who?”  
She laughed in a slightly evil manor as he cowered caught in her panties unable to escape. Where could he go? As she stood like this either of the leg holes would mean instant death from the fall below he was trapped. He couldn’t believe he had fallen for her rouse it was like a dream , her voice so much like Tiffani in her whispered words..what had he done?  
“SSandy”  
He stuttered afraid to be in her clutches once more  
“In the flesh little one did you miss me? I bet you did. So now the big bad mumma has you were she wants you , what are going to do little man are you going to put up a fight or give yourself to me?”  
“never”  
He cried but then noticed her body growing before him.  
“are you getting smaller in my knickers down there or am I going up in the world?”  
Sandy smiled as she increased in height considerably. When the growth spurt had settled she was another 4 inches taller a rival for her daughter and perhaps more.  
“I do love that sensation I cant wait to do that again”  
“No please let me go!”  
“Ok your free to go.”  
She smiled down in a challenging fashion.  
“well that’s if you can get out of my knickers in the next two minutes”  
The elastic above snapped shut as she released it and the material pressed firmly on Zal much more firmly than before due to her size increase. He struggled to move making his way to top of her knickers a sheer climb against her smooth flesh. It was impossible to escape!  
“please let me out, please don’t do this!”  
The light poured in again as he slumped back down to the base before her sex he was hot and sticky now and defeated by a simple pair of giant silk panties.  
“Now I know you wont give yourself willingly little one and I need a lot more from you before this night is out.”  
Her iron like fingers plucked him free and she held him before her face.  
“If you lighten up you may find you’ll enjoy some of tonight my little insect”  
“no Sandy please I beg”  
“aww your begging me now are you that’s sweet but futile im not a nice giantess like my daughter”  
Zal could see he was actually downstairs in the kitchen and on the side below there was a clear plastic cylinder the size of a large bucket to Zal and thimble sized to a normal person , he didn’t like the look of it one bit.  
“whats going on? What are you going to do to me? Tiffani!!! Tiffani!!!”  
He called out loud and Sandy laughed.  
“Tiffani is fast asleep and that little voice of yours well she wouldn’t hear it in a million years so please just accept your fate”  
She placed Zal on the kitchen sideboard a clear section with no objects except or the tube and he looked up at Sandy who was clearly enjoying her power over him. He could see nowhere to run her hands would be on him in seconds.  
“See this little tube here I want you to fill it tonight as much as you can in the next few hours, believe me I know what’s possible from you virile little Tallions”  
“No I wont….”  
A huge hand slammed down beside him making his knees weak and the sideboard flex a little enough to set Zal on his backside. But more scary than that it almost landed on top of him with her huge fingers only a foot away at his own scale.  
“I thought you might resist so Ive come prepared”  
She walked off to another side and Zal desperately ran , he sprinted as fast as he could covering a hundred metres of the bland sideboard in seconds. When suddenly he was caught in a net? He smashed into a white wall which he could see was silk and lots of it!  
He was stopped in his tracks and covered by a giant g-string! A giant silk g string that swallowed his little body up in its abundance of feminine material.  
“well what do you know these g strings arent that small after all”  
Sandy laughed and her hand balled Zal up in the material and carried him back to the area next to the tube. Unfolding the material he stood on the gigantic silky surface. Sandy pulled it up around him and the material conformed around his body stretching impossibly high on all sides.  
“I bet you didn’t think you would get into my panties again so quickly did you little one”  
Sandy was completely amused by his helplessness.  
“Dear, dear my tiny little space man you should have stayed in your little universe”  
Zal managed to stand and tried to climb at the sides of the g string but Sandy shook him down its slippery smooth walls.  
“No , you don’t back down you go.”  
He watched through the thin almost transparent like material as she held him with one hand by thin straps way above and then her free hand reached into a drawer under the sideboard. retrieving something.  
“I wonder what it would be like if I traveled to your world?”  
“Just think Zal a big 200 foot woman stomping through the middle of your city, I could rule your planet don’t you think?”  
“Your mad!”  
“Still a little fight in you eh? Well not for much longer you see this substance here is going to make you all mine and probably make you forget tonight ever happened”  
She loosened the gap at the top of the g string material and began to tip some white powder into the centre with him , he fought it realizing it was some sort of drug but his efforts where in vein as he began to feel its effects his mind began to swirl and then…….  
  
“Zal? Hey tiny wake up”  
Zal forced his eyes open and saw a much larger set of eyes gleaming at him.  
“I didn’t think you were going to ever wake up sleepy you must have slept well in my knickers eh?”  
“what um yeh”  
He felt very groggy and heavy headed and much unlike his normal self.  
“woah what a head its pounding like a herd of Totans have slithered over me”  
“a herd of what?”  
”oh, a very large mammal on Tallion about as big as one of those feet of yours”  
It was then Zal recalled it was his girlfriends birthday.  
“Tiffani I almost forgot its tradition for me to say happy birthday to you”  
“Thanks, baby. How about a birthday kiss eh?”  
Zal was taken before her lips and this time he instigated the kiss by leaning across and placing his own onto her giant lips covering the smallest fraction of their enormity.  
“thanks Sweetie”  
“I only wish I had a present for you I know its your planets tradition to offer gifts”  
“Well just look at me tiny you’ve given me nearly 12 inches in height and several inches more around my bust these are gifts that ill enjoy for the rest of my life.”  
“then you feel better about things this morning?”  
“I thought about little else since I woke and pulled you out of my panties and im pleased with the way I am it’s the world that has to get used to the new me”  
“glad to see you have come to terms with things Tiffani. As for me I feel rather fragile this morning my head is very heavy I hope it isn’t your atmosphere on this planet reacting with me some how”  
“mmm, well im sorry you’ve got a headache Zal, Ill try and keep my giant voice down ok. But little man we have a lot to do today as you can see im ready to go out”  
Tiffani tilted her hand down with Zal held securely within it so he could see her outfit. She had some very clingy red lycra running shorts which ended at her exposed her navel and taught stomach. On top she had a short black t-shirt that clung to her form so tight that any imperfections would have been clear but there were none to be seen only the majestic and dominant outline of her bust. Way below she had squeezed some sports sandals onto her feet.  
“There wasn’t much else to fit me so im skipping my morning sessions at college for the shopping mall to blow my savings and Im not leaving you at home this time so as you don’t need breakfast you’d better get dressed because im gonna introduce to what earth girls do best”  
“Sex?”  
Zal grinned up from her hand  
“Shopping”  
She replied and set him down on her bedside with his clothes. In a matter of minutes he was dressed and looked up at the slinky outline of Tiffani wondering where she was going to carry him today and hoping his head would clear with some fresh air.  
“Im ready my goddess”  
“Then im afraid its in my purse for you tiny?”  
“Your Purse?”  
“this little bag we women carry it kind holds our currency and well practically everything we might need in an emergency”  
A huge twenty foot tall white structure made of leather came down aside Zal , he looked up at it and noted the large gold catches at the top of this towering structure and realises this was where he would enter.  
“Is this safe? , I would rather ride on your person”  
“Idd love you to as well Zal but these shorts are tight as it is and I wouldn’t want a little lump in the front of them, that might look a little strange and…….”  
She lifted him up in mid speech bringing him over the scoop neck of her t-shirt so that he could see the impressive forms squeezed inside.  
“…..none of my little bras fit me anymore so there’s no going in here unless you want to risk falling between these monsters . So as much as I hate it your in my purse Ill be careful I promise and its only until I find something that fits the new me , ok?”  
She kissed him and slowly he was taken into the dark confines of her purse. Inside there was a jumble of objects from lipsticks to compacts to brushes. All of these womanly possessions were taller than he was and he was afraid of them crushing him into a paste as she walked. Looking up he could see her piercing green eyes filling the top of the entrance to the purse.  
“It’s a bit busy in there isn’t it? Guess I carry pretty much everything and anything which doesn’t leave much room for tiny boyfriends”  
“Tiffani this doesn’t seem wise whatever these things are they are a lot larger and a lot heavier than I am , I may not make it to this mall you refer to and if I do I may be in a different shape by the time you pick me out again”  
“mmm you have a point little fella I guess most of my junk is bigger than little ole you in there I don’t know what I was thinking …being a giantess isn’t easy I must think of things from your perspective in future. Those things in there seem so little to me yet to you every days things like lipsticks and my hairbrush would weigh a ton. Sorry Zal ill try again”  
Her eyes disappeared as she had a re-think and Zal just listen to her moving around outside the purse. Suddenly two enormous fingers came in to grab him and lifted him free much to his relief.  
“First Zal you need to hold still ok and trust me”  
He listened to her instruction as she held him face down on her left palm. He then felt something pierce the back of his flight suit above the waist band and a small and cold piece of smooth metal slide in.  
“What’s happening?”  
“Keep still , nearly there”  
She answered and then Zal was allowed to stand. There was something relatively heavy attached to him from behind but he couldn’t turn to see it.  
“that is so cute”  
Tiffani girlishly giggled  
“What?”  
  
##Part 18  
  
There was a slight tug from behind and he felt his feet leave the floor he was suspended and what looked like a huge golden hoop traveled into the back of his flight suit and out again supporting his weight.  
“You my little boyfriend make the most adorable little ear ring. I only wish I had two of you now”  
With her laughter tailing off she lifted him to her ear and attached the gold hoop leaving Zal dangling just below her ear lobe. He looked on helplessly as she walked to a mirror and then he saw just how easily he had become a piece of jewellery for his giant woman to wear. Her enormous beautiful face smiled as she stared at him in the mirror pleased with her inspired solution.  
“But Tiffani people will see me now im dangling from your ear”  
“Well my little living earring I’ve got that covered, or should I say I’ve got you covered if I wear my long hair down like so”  
Zal felt a curtain of gold fall over him as her hair softly brushed into him hiding him from view. Through the long strands that settled around him he could see out to the world beyond but only just due to the thickness of the long blonde hair that shielded him and encased him in its fragrant aroma. Satisfied she had solved the problem of transporting Zal she walked out of the house and down to the mall. Zal was swung around at first with every step she made as the earring moved with her motion. Eventually he steadied himself by clasping some hair so that the swaying was minimal.  
“This is the mall little guy and your gonna love it , its filled with women’s clothes shops of every conceivable variety”  
Tiffani whispered as she walked  
“Nothing like this exists on Tallion , our women simply specify new body suits when the material begins to wear , there is only one organization that manufactures our clothing there is little choice for individualism”  
Zal began  
“only at formal occasion do our women differentiate their appearance with their family colours displayed upon arm bands”  
“How boring Zal , as your going to see women here strive to look individual , we accessorize in so many different ways …..your in for a crash course in earth fashion baby I think your gonna enjoy this trip”  
An hour and ten shops worth of browsing later and Tiffani entered her favorite shop. she was familiar with the assistant but wondered if she would recognize her now.  
“Hi Cheryl”  
“Hello um miss , how can I help you today?”  
Tiffani smiled as the assistant looked surprised at her height but obviously didn’t acknowledge who she actually was.  
“Cheryl its me Tiffani”  
The teenager looked up at the amazon blonde beauty before her and was stunned.  
”Tiffani , woah! What happened your so tall!”  
“Oh long story Cheryl bit of freak growth thing my doctors said there’s nothing to worry about but that’s kind of why im here I need some new clothes”  
“You’ve come to the right place”  
Cheryl step out from behind the counter and led Tiffani to the side of shop by the fitting rooms , whilst they walked Tiffani couldn’t help but grin at how short Cheryl appeared to her now especially as they used to be of equal stature.  
“Here let me measure you”  
Cheryl went around Tiffani taking various measurements with a tailors tape and was very surprised at the results.  
“My god your towering! Your inside leg is nearly 40 inches yet you still have a pretty tiny waist its remarkable. Your figure is like a life size version of a Barbie doll”  
“Do you cater for us taller than average girls?”  
“We sure do, you’ll have to come to the tall’s section over here with me so what sort of outfit are we looking for?”  
“Well I need something conventional for college right now and something sexy for my birthday tonight”  
“Oh congratulations Ill have to see if we find you some extra discount today”  
Zal was suddenly immersed into a world of giant women’s clothing as he glimpsed rack after rack of giant dresses , skirts and tops roll past. As Tiffani browsed through the choices , he couldn’t believe the amount of diversity on offer. At one stage Tiffani reached into her hair and twisted Zal around in order to bury his vision deep into her long blonde hair , it was clear she was keen not to allow him the opportunity to see some of the clothes she was hoping to buy. Once she had made some selections she tried on several pairs of shoes and a pair of long white leather knee boots as she sat down on a stool , she was quick to decide and whispered to Zal.  
“There’s no guy tonight im gonna look up to that’s for sure”  
Cheryl came over from the lingerie section with a number of huge bras and panties draped over her arm.  
“That was a challenge… you’re a big girl to accommodate up top we hardly stock any pretty 34 F bra’s with matching knickers in your size”  
“well these kind of blossomed with the rest of me but my boyfriends not complaining”  
Tiffani giggled which shook Zal.  
“He’s certainly got a lot of woman to handle if you don’t mind me saying , I bet he’s really tall isn’t he?”  
Tiffani laughed at her comment.  
“actually he’s really and I mean really short, way shorter than you even”  
“No way! And you don’t mind that considering your extraordinarily tall?”  
”Not at all I really enjoy it and I know he does”  
On that note and with her final selections in hand Tiffani prepared to enter the changing rooms. Once behind the privacy of the changing room door she un-hooked Zal and placed him on the small seat surface below as she stripped. He craned his head back to admire her ready to see that perfect body revealed once more but Tiffani decided to have some privacy.  
“Sorry Zal but no peeking I don’t want you to see this hot outfit on me until tonight and im going to try that on before I slip into the other new outfit so Ill give you something to occupy yourself my little lover”  
Zal didn’t know what to expect but in a very playful manor he saw her remove her skin tight t-shirt and without a further word of warning she lifted him up and enveloped him in the mass of material.  
“Tiffani!”  
He bellowed but she ignored his shouts and left him with the relatively heavy weight of a woman’s top that could have easily covered half of his spaceship and it plunged his tiny form into an all consuming darkness leaving absolutely no idea of which way to crawl out. Tiffani sniggered as she watched the small hardly noticeable lump trying in vein to escape her top and she proceeded to try on her outfit and check that it met her approval.  
“wow, I even think I look hot so your gonna love this look tiny”  
He could hear her words through the cloth way above but he didn’t rise to respond as he was fixated on freeing himself to see her. However by the time he managed to crawl out of the collapsed arm of her top Tiffani was glancing in the mirror as she smoothed down the long pencil style skirt of the more conventional outfit she had selected. Stood below on the chair his view was just the vast plain of this dark blue skirt rising into the air and below. He continued the journey of his eyes higher to discover she had a nice thin white blouse on with full sleeves that billowed at the arms yet followed the ample contours of her upper body very closely. Looking to the side of her she had already folded up the outfit that she didn’t want him to see.  
“You made it out of my top then tiny? Well done”  
“ that wasn’t fair Tiffani I only wanted to see how wonderful you looked”  
“well you will learn with us earth women that we like to spend time getting ready when we are going out and I wouldn’t want to spoil the surprise when I haven’t even done my hair and make up..I promise it will be worth the wait little one”  
“On Tallion women don’t spend time on their appearance , if they want to change their look they use a facial enhancer to apply shading and outlining to their faces and a hair wand to alter their hair , it takes minutes”  
“well we are not quite so sophisticated mr space age and my beauty comes from manual application of Revlon’s finest..”  
“Revlon?”  
”Don’t worry about it Zal, so little man now I have clothes that fit you have somewhere to ride like in the pocket on this new blouse”  
Zal was eased gently into the large pocket positioned upon her left breast and he was tumbled around as she went to pay for her goods and then as they left the shopping centre. The college was the next port of call but there was hesitation in Tiffani’s stride as she approached knowing that her more imposing figure would generate a lot of questions and a lot of commotion from everyone. She didn’t mind this one bit in a social environment but she wasn’t sure about facing everyone at college as she approached. The idea of towering over every teacher and infact everyone she knew in this complex was very appealing but something was holding her back as she stood looking across the car park leading to the main entrance.  
“are we there yet Tiffani? I feel rather nauseous being in this pocket”  
Tiffani was distracted from her thoughts hearing the little voice coming out of her pocket. She looked down sweetly at the small handsome figure sat inside her pocket and couldn’t help but smile at how tiny he was.  
“Nauseous? You mean sick, why? Hey don’t throw up in my pocket darling this is a new blouse you know”  
“Im err ok well now they’ve stopped moving”  
“they?”  
Tiffani look confused for a second at his words then realized he was feeling the effects of her womanly charms jiggling with her walk and couldn’t help but stifle a laugh.  
“Im so sorry Zal Ill try not to walk so fast”  
“Tiffani where are we at your college?”  
“Outside Zal but im not sure I can go in it doesn’t feel right”  
“because of your new size?”  
“don’t get me wrong Zal I love being this tall but I don’t think I want all the finger pointing and questions just yet not today, maybe I should call in ill and have a week off that way I can pretend I have been to the doctors and my height is a condition of some sort…yes that’s what im gonna do. Its my birthday I don’t need to be here today”  
Decision made and it wasn’t long before they reached Tiffani’s home. For a while they relaxed as she stretched out on the couch watching television and Zal sat on her stomach checking progress of his ship repairs remotely.  
“The ships plating is almost restored the Trelan of your mothers was better than expected”  
His words didn’t raise any responses from the giantess. Zal put away his technology and stood up on the white surface of her blouse. He hadn’t looked behind since she placed him there some time ago and was quite astonished to see her face was totally beyond view even as he stood up. The rise of her white blouse was so steep that it caused him to crane his neck back to appreciate the height of her chest.  
“Tiffani I said my ship repairs are all in hand…”  
He stopped speaking and realized she was asleep her deep breathing gave it away. Smiling he decided to have some fun on her body and walked up to the base of her bust and realized how impossible it was to scale with that thin blouse stretching up and towering over his head so far. The smooth white exterior encasing her giant assets wasn’t scalable without equipment he definitely couldn’t climb them and that made him laugh inside at how puny he was on this planet that a woman’s mere breasts posed a real barrier to him. But this conclusion that he couldn’t go over them posed the teasing decision to enter her blouse. He followed the trail of plate sized buttons until they rose sharply upwards in line with her jutting bosom as it soared vertically. The buttons had no stress upon them here and he grabbed a huge button and clasped it with two hands angling it back through the opening until it released revealing the tanned flesh of her body beneath. Zal walked into the gap and under the canopy of her blouse to see a small valley between her breasts formed by her new bra. He walked along and saw a large decorative bow that signified the centre of her bra between the breasts it fascinated him the attention to detail these earth garments had. Stepping over it his foot caught in the bow and it became unraveled as he in turn was tripped over in mid stride.  
He laughed that his fall hadn’t alerted the sleeping beauty and he continue through the relatively tight gap that was offered between her amazing breasts. Idly he ran his hands upon the softness of the new silk bra and then along the flesh that emerged as he began to exit towards her neck. As he stood under her chin he looked back at the entrance to her giant blouse and the giant cleavage smiling broadly as his Tallion hormones acknowledged the sexiness of that sight. Suddenly Tiffani woke up and moved a little too fast for Zal to compensate as she half sat up and he fell and rolled into her cleavage as the terrain below him became a slope.  
“woah!”  
He cried and Tiffani giggled to see him plunging into the gap of her cleavage. He finally rolled to a stop down at her stomach close to where he had entered and where the blouse offered no headroom.  
“Now where did that little boyfriend of mine go?, I swear I left him sat up here on top of my blouse?”  
She acted well and Zal called up  
“Tiffani in here”  
“Oh, looks like your inside my blouse now how did that happen I wonder?”  
She proceeded to unbutton her blouse slowly getting towards the lower half where he now laid.  
“There you are my tiny lover have you been exploring under my clothes whilst I was asleep you naughty little man?”  
“Who could blame a guy with a body like yours Tiffani?”  
Zal grinned in a cheeky fashion and was able to stand on his feet as the blouse material parted either side of him.  
“Hey and what’s this?”  
Her eyes spied the untied bow upon the exterior of her bra.  
“You didn’t think that little silk bow would untie my bra did you tiny that’s not what its for you know”  
She teased him and he felt her hand travel around him as two fingers hoisted him up. Then slowly he was taken along her body towards her bra once again.  
“This bow is actually what we girls use to tie up naughty little boyfriends to our bras so they can dangle between our giant sexy boobs”  
Before Zal was able to put up a fight he was pressed with his back down in the centre of the material of her bra and the two ends of the bow were just long enough to meet around his waist in a small bow,  
“Hey!”  
He yelled playfully as Tiffani laughed at how easily she overpowered him with her fingers holding him down as she secured him to the centre of her bra.  
“You haven’t become attached to my bra have you Zal? Ha!”  
He girlish giggles rose and he felt the huge breasts jiggle around him.  
It was then that the doorbell rang.  
“Ooh, I wonder who that is tiny Idd best get the door eh?”  
“but wait im….”  
Tiffani sat up and Zal was held fast by the silky fastening across his waist. He watched the buttons rapidly close the blouse over his head and he was now covered from view and dangling from her bra like a decoration himself. With a further giggle at his plight Tiffani went to the door and answered it.  
“I thought you had done a bunk today so I skipped off early to see ya…happy birthday girlfriend!”  
Zal was suddenly squashed as the two friends hugged and two bodies collided  
briefly.  
“thanks what’s the pressy?”  
“Oh just a little something from me to you but you have to unwrap it in the bedroom”  
“really?…”  
Tiffani said in an intrigued voice  
“then lets go to the bedroom right now girl”  
Zal jangled around as Tiffani ascended the stairs and reached the bedroom he was going to shout out having felt the joke of his predicament had gone far enough but then felt strange with Corrina being there , did he want her to see how powerless he was? How a simple girls ribbon on her bra had trapped him with ease as good as any iron chains. For now he kept quiet and listened as he heard the rustling of paper as her new gift was unwrapped.  
“chocolate flavour how wonderful shall we use it now!”  
The girls laughed and hugged again. There was a sound of material and then Tiffani’s body shook which signified Corrina had joined her also.  
“So Tiff where’s that handsome little space-man of yours”  
“Oh he’s playing hide and seek perhaps you should see if you can find him ”  
There was a small laugh and Zal felt himself laying back in line with Tiffani’s body as she was presumably laying down on her bed. He quickly pulled at the soft ribbon that bonded him to the bra but it was no use those powerful fingers had made a bow that was beyond his strength to loosen. He was stuck there like it or not and about to be discovered. The hugeness of Tiffanis breasts moved dangerously aside him as a dark shadow loomed over the blouse and made contact with them. It was Corrina’s hand caressing them each from outside and about to come inside.  
“These are so much bigger Tiff and still so firm”  
  
##Part 19  
  
There was a kissing sound and then the buttons of the blouse below released just in two sections enough that a searching set of fingers could enter. Zal recognized the red nail polish of Corrina as the large hand closed towards him with its long eager digits outstretched ready to embrace the mass of those breasts that dwarfed him so well. Her hand missed him and diverted to her left breast cupping hardly any of it and squeezing it gently and rhythmically. Zal was a forced spectator as the Tiffani was fondled and he again found it strangely arousing to watch those breasts easily outsize the comparatively small but yet still giant woman’s hand upon them.  
“mmm…that’s nice. Why don’t you take off my bra”  
Zal knew this was coming as the hands retreated out of the blouse and the rest of the buttons released so the white ceiling that sheltered him from view was taken away.  
Suddenly he was greeted with the awesome view of Corrina who was straddling Tiffani and wearing only a blue silk bra and matching g-string. Her long brunette hair was dancing around her face and she looked down over her bust and smiled at Zal fixed as he was to the bra below.  
“Hello tiny”  
She said breathlessly and in a sensual manor as he could see the desire in her eyes as they feasted upon his girlfriends curvaceous frame between her thighs. Zal was speechless as he looked up and down the enormous figure of Corrina as it was now hovering over him.  
“You do look awfully small and awfully cute down there”  
“He’s got a bit of thing about my bras so Ive made him part of one”  
Tiffani offered.  
“But its time this came off”  
In seconds Tiffani pulled down her shoulder straps easing pressure on her bra and then peeled back a bra cup off her right nipple. Zal watched as Corrina lowered her boobs getting larger and larger as they began to fill his world and then at the last moment the huge blue bra cup moved away as her lips fell around Tiffani’s exposed nipple and Zal was encased in long silky brunette hair whilst the action continued. Slowly the other nipple was exposed and the hair slithered its softness across him as Corrina switched her attentions. She pulled herself back up and grinned down.  
“time you got undressed too little man”  
“good idea”  
Tiffani complimented and Corrina removed Tiffani’s bra with Zal still attached.  
“You do seem to like hanging around big girls bras don’t you tiny”  
The girls laughed at Corrina’s comments.  
“and what a bra this is , you could carry footballs inside this girl”  
Corrina held the bra up high marveling at the cup size in contrast to her own petite looking and fairly modest c cups.  
“Or a whole Tallion soccer team”  
Tiffani added but the joke went over Zal’s head he didn’t even know what soccer was but Corrina found it amusing.  
“Shall we untie you tiny?”  
Corrina teased as she saw his dilemma with Zal now pulling at the ribbon that secured him with utter frustration.  
“please”  
He looked up into her face feeling defeated.  
“what do you think Tiff fancy a three some?”  
“always”  
With the sliding of a huge polished fingernail into the bow that bonded him, he watched the knot fall loose to the smallest amount of effort and he tumbled down several feet and onto the soft terrain of Tiffani’s bare breast below. Zal grabbed the nipple in order not to slide off and lay across the slope of the huge areola beneath him looking up to see what the girls planned next.  
“Is that sexy laying naked on my friends gigantic breast eh Zal? How about I we make a breast sandwich with you as the tiny filling”  
Before Zal could speak he was staring up lustfully as Corrina removed her bra and then lowered her giant breast towards him. Although she was an average C cup her breast was still many times larger than Zal and dominated his view dramatically as it seemed to increase in size coming slowly towards him with its jiggling mass. He braced for impact as the soft flesh landed on top of his naked body planting but a mere fraction of its weight onto his tiny form. Zal reveled in the bliss of two breasts connecting and consuming him in their warm flesh. His body was pressed firmly on all sides and sunk a little into Tiffani’s breast as Corrina pressed and mashed her smaller breast over him. The feeling for Zal was indescribable to be kissed by the sexy flesh of two mammoth female orbs and despite the fact that he was beginning to find it hard to breathe he was as hard as he had ever been while the sensation lasted. Finally Corrina eased up and pulled away to see his reaction.  
“I think he enjoyed that a lot Tiff , he likes being squished between our giant titties”  
“that was …..phenomenal”  
Zal gasped as he attempted to stand using Tiffani’s nipple to aid him to his feet.  
“and there’s more to come little guy , Corrina how about you apply some of my present you bought me right here”  
She gestured to the breast he stood on and Zal watched as Corrina reached over and grabbed a small pot of some description putting her fingers inside it. With a mischievous grin he watched her fingers come out and they were covered in a thick brown liquid.  
“Look up here Zal….”  
Corrina explained as she examined her dripping fingers  
“…This is the most wonderful substance on earth a delicacy we call chocolate and what I have here is some sexy chocolate body paint and your gonna love it”  
No sooner said and those very fingers came down to coat Zal in the sticky liquid as she held him in her free hand and ran the pads of her chocolate covered digits all over his legs and torso. It felt wonderful as it coated his erect manhood and thighs and he moaned in pleasure as she applied it so delicately.  
“ooh Corrina that looks like a particularly tasty little treat for me”  
Tiffani piped up from behind and as if on queue and Zal was lifted and dangled teasingly over the cavernous mouth of his giant girlfriend as she tipped her head back ready to receive him.  
“ooh he looks good enough to eat”  
Corrina began as she lowered him toward her friends open mouth and teased his tiny feet still dripping with the chocolate over the surface of Tiffani’s lower lip.  
“remember not to bite Tiff this is one treat you have to savor and suck”  
“Oh yes!”  
Zal shouted as he felt a huge tongue come out to greet him and then the hot  
and moist enclosure of Tiffani’s mouth rose around as he was lowered inside. Her tongue befriended him as her lips closed down and left just his face clamped tenderly between them. Corrina’s fingers had released him as Tiffani sucked on his body removing all traces of the chocolate before she pulled him free and just in time as he was feeling ready to burst!. Now covered in a film of her warm saliva he was placed on the cabinet surface temporarily whilst the girls repositioned. Now Tiffani took control and allowed Corrina to lay back . She gently caressed and rubbed her own body on top of her friends as she slowly shifted her head down and between her legs. Zal had held off his climax for now but was stood there with his arousal still at boiling point as he watched the giantesses pleasuring each others bodies. Smothering Corrinas nipples with the chocolate topping and working her tongue around them Tiffani then drew a brown line of chocolate down Corrinas length over her taught stomach and navel and ended it at her sex below. She picked up Zal and set him on her friends belly as she proceeded to spreads Corrina’s legs apart and please her with an energetic tongue. Zal heard the booming moans of the brunette rumble and her hand clasped him and slid him around on her belly face first as she made circles with the chocolate sauce using his body as a paint brush. Zal was still in heaven as he glided over the sexy terrain on a layer of the brown lubrication. He didn’t know how much more he could stand of this treatment before he lost himself when suddenly her sex became his new destination. The view was amazing as he fell under a curtain of blonde locks wildly flying around as Tiffani buried her face into the task at hand. Her big green eyes were alight with passion as she caught sight of Zal being guided down the chocolate trail into the small jungle of pubic hair , she knew what her friend wanted her to do with her tiny boyfriend.  
“Tiff let me feel him inside me, all the way like you did”  
Her voice expressed her heightened state of arousal and Zal left one set of giant women’s fingers for another as Tiffani gently teased the opening of her friend with his tiny body making sure his legs pushed inside every now and then stimulating her erotic zones.  
“please Tiff I want him”  
Corrina moaned deeply  
“I want a man inside me a whole little man, please”  
She gasped and was almost pleading and Zal held his breath as he saw Tiffani’s spare hand making an enterance for Zal as she eased his body expertly into her friends wetness. The same sensations as before hit Zal but his stay was more brief this time as he wriggled his body inside Corrina and she climaxed very loudly. He was pulled free rapidly in order that he didn’t join in with the orgasm and just in time because he was finding it hard to contain himself now.  
“Tiffani I need to release, I need it now!”  
He squirmed uncomfortably in her hand the burning taking hold due to all the teasing he been subjected to. Tiffani smiled down at him and looked across at a panting Corrina who was trying to recover from an intense orgasm.  
“Corrina fancy a little more up top?”  
“what? What do you mean?”  
She managed to say between breathes  
“big boobs , do you want bigger boobs? How would you like to upgrade those little c cups and get higher in the alphabet?”  
Corrina realized her friends suggestion and simply beamed her acceptance to the opportune proposal in the form of a huge smile. Zal was offered up to her large c cups and knew what he had to do. Standing on the platform of Tiffani’s hand he was inline with a nipple just smaller than his own head he pushed himself deep into it as he had done before with Tiffani and he felt the breathe of his girlfriend as she encouraged him from behind.  
“that’s it my little lover make love to her giant breasts make them bigger make them sexier, make them grow”  
His length began to pump his enjoyment and Zal was in ecstasy as Tiffani remembered to transfer him from one nipple to the other before he was fully spent. Zal collapsed on her hand satisfied and drained. She placed him down upon Corrina’s underwear on the floor as the Corrina stood up with Tiffani and they embraced hugging each other for an instant. Zal laid back on the silk underwear it smelt of Corrina but then so did he already. Looking up the two giantesses from the floor he was still amazed at how they towered over him . Not far from two giant sets of bare feet he was too tired to be nervous and found himself dropping off from his exertion.  
“hey sexy are you going to wake up?”  
A distant voice called and Zal opened his eyes to see Tiffani’s smiling down at him. He realised he had fallen asleep and was in a drawer of her cabinet.  
“Tiffani , boy I must have been exhausted”  
“Ill say its nine o’clock you’ve been out for hours baby. I left you wrapped up in a pair of my knickers in this little drawer and you were flat out… did the big girls wear you out tiny?”  
“I guess my energy levels were sapped my goddess but im recovering”  
“good because im ready to party and Corrina’s going to be here any second”  
“then we are going night clubbing as you termed it?”  
“You betcha and its time your clapped eyes on my new outfit”  
Her hand covered him and didn’t allow him any sneak previews as it set him down upon a surface. He was facing the opposite way and towards a wall and obviously back on the familiar cabinet once more , she certainly wanted to keep up the suspense he thought to himself as he turned to see her clothes. What could he say she looked stunning , spectacular even and was oozing with sex appeal. She wore some incredibly high heeled shiny white boots that rose up her shapely legs just below the knee and after the longest sexiest set of legs he’d ever witness coming out of them he saw the tightest and shortest of white figure hugging dresses clinging to her curves. Her breasts stood out proud and defied gravity and the dress only just seemed able to contain their mass but did help to display a world of cleavage bursting out of the low neck line. Her hair was up and styled to perfection with a long intricately fashioned pony tail dangling its long blonde length down her back. Her face was as pretty as ever but enhanced with perfectly applied makeup just lightly pronouncing her eyes making them even more prominent and outlining her lips with a shade of pink that made them draw attention and look even more kissable than ever. She twirled in delight seeing his loss for words and from any angle he was mesmerized by her shape. From the side view her bust projected out showing its enormity in vast contrast to her slim waist and almost to the exaggerated proportions of an animated sex siren yet they looked so natural upon her new towering stature. From behind her rear was firm and held a distracting sexy shape in the dress and wiggled in that feminine way as she took the slightest of steps.  
“Well am I hot?”  
She posed with leaning on the wall of the bedroom for an instant.  
“on fire!”  
Zal shouted his approval.  
“You see some things are worth waiting for”  
She walked in a slinky manor towards him and leaned over to pick him up. If Zal didn’t know better he would have sworn she had increased her chest size but he knew it was just the way this dress presented them. He was taken to the bathroom where she carefully cleaned him with some liquid soap a very enjoyable process for Zal and then she allowed him to get dressed. When Zal was ready Tiffani lifted him downstairs and waited for her friend as she fixed herself an early alcoholic drink to get in the mood. She noticed in the kitchen a letter on the floor she hadn’t seen earlier that day presuming it had been knocked off the side.  
“what’s this I wonder?”  
Inside was a birthday card from her mother and a note.  
“Sorry I cant be there for your birthday. I guess we have even more reason to make it up to each other. I have had to leave in a rush to catch up with your father and address a few matters with him I don’t know how long I will be gone. Mum”  
“That’s odd ? I thought Dad was hundreds of miles away at the conference I cant believe mothers left like that ? I think something is going on between the two of them….its part of why she has been so anti-men and behaving weird”  
“guess you’ll know in a few days eh? Please don’t let it spoil your night tonight my goddess im sure things will work out between your parents”  
“mm I suppose…yes your right sod the two of them we are gonna party hard tonight little man! Ive got eighteen years to celebrate and its probably the last night that ill share with my tiny boyfriend”…  
She lifted him up for a kiss and then held off.  
“nearly forgot myself then and covered you in lipstick”  
She laughed as the doorbell rang.  
”Corrina”  
  
##Part 20  
  
Leaving Zal at on the kitchen surface next to the drainer he heard the click clack of yet more heels entering the wooden hallway and a lot of complimentary exchanges between the two girls. Corrina stepped in to the kitchen and also looked like a man magnet. Her hair was down and somehow seemed to have more volume to it with a number of loose attractive curls strategically formed around her face. She wore a two piece outfit comprising of a short black skirt that sparkled in the light and this was topped with her tantalizingly exposed mid-rift. Below she had some high heel black sandals and painted toe nails. Zal studied the legs moving in his direction and the shoes below on the kitchen tiles when all of a sudden he looked across to see her top. He couldn’t miss it! She wore a matching crop top to pair with her skirt but it was the shape of her bust that took Zal by surprise. She wasn’t any more miss average, what bounced delightfully infront him now was a girl with a very healthy bust and this exceedingly large bosom jutted out proudly to wanting to say hi to every mans eyes in proximity.  
“Thanks for these Zal”  
She cupped her breasts briefly smiling at the fact that her hands failed to hold them adequately.  
“I had to borrow one of Tiffs old push up bras im a double D now thanks to you tiny….”  
“…and looking good with it”  
Tiffani added and reached behind her friend clasping her breasts for a second. Zal was shocked not at the busty ness of Corrina but at the height of Tiffani behind her as he saw her green eyes and blonde hair looking clear over the tall brunettes head.  
“Tiff your even taller! You must be a small giantess to even your earth men!”  
He remarked  
“thanks to these heels I am”  
She stepped out and he could see the difference more clearly.  
“he is right girl you make me feel short and im not used to that. A few days ago you looked way up to me and now im down here and you make me feel like your little sister”  
Tiffani laughed  
“Im off the scale upon the chart in my room but I think im seven foot two maybe three or there about whilst im wearing these”  
“this is gonna be some night, I cant wait to see the reaction we get in the club as the tallest girls in town”  
The girls laughed and prepared to leave.  
“are you sure its wise for me to join you Tiffani?”  
Zal felt a little nervous he had to admit.  
“Of course its my birthday and I want my man with me, close to me”  
She smiled and lifted him up to her face.  
“Im going to squeeze you into my cleavage because this dress doesn’t come with pockets but im sure you wont be disappointed to hear that and this way when I dance you come along for the ride”  
Zal was about to say something when down he went. His eyes fell to his feet as he watched a cleavage line that had to be over fifteen feet long begin to gobble them up.  
Soon his legs were gulped down into the deep womanly curves and then his arms . He was sinking readily into the paradise and enormity of her breasts and overwhelmed with her heady perfume and the warmth that radiated from them. Soon Zal’s head was barely visible as she eased him deeper. From the outside he was out of sight now unless someone was looking directly overhead and for Zal he could just about see out but his movements were very restricted. They set off and the girls summoned a taxi which took them direct to the nightclub. Zal was glad of the sound dampening offered by Tiffani’s enormous boobs as he heard the alien music pumping away at high volume from all around him as they entered the night club.  
”Tiff did you see that bouncer back there! Ha! His face was a picture when he saw that he wasn’t as tall as your boobs!”  
“I know but did you check the barman out his tongue was on the carpet when we both walked past!”  
They both continued to chat and laugh as they walked around to find somewhere to sit that over looked the dance floor. Finally as they sat Corrina went off to get some drinks as Tiffani peeked down into her dress to check on Zal.  
“enjoying yourself tiny? Want some air?”  
He shouted up yes but his voice was drowned out by the environment. Carefully to avoid anyone seeing him Tiffani lifted Zal plucking him from the safety of her bosom to let him rest on the table behind some beer bottles that had yet to be collected.  
Now able to look around he was amazed at the curious sights of this vast room full of giants enjoying themselves drinking and dancing to the pounding music.  
“a bit like your space ports Zal?”  
Tiffani saw him taking in the scene  
“no nothing like them!”  
He shouted but she couldn’t pick up on his voice. Corrina joined them and almost flattened Zal with a huge cocktail drink by mistake.  
“Oops sorry tiny I almost didn’t see you there!”  
They chatted for a few minutes as Zal amused himself observing the colorful and inventive outfits that the giants around him wore. What he did notice more was the amount of giantesses seemed to outweigh the giants which was a pleasant discovery as he really didn’t fancy seeing a giant up close.  
“So Tiff shall we hit the floor”  
“after you , oh and remember Zal”  
Corrina picked up Zal and looked around to check no one was watching as she popped him into the front of her skirt so he was held by the elasticated band and able to look over. He didn’t mind this position at all as it offered him a field of view comprising of seemingly hundreds of giant women’s legs and gyrating rear ends shaking about. The dance floor was dark enough that he wasn’t easily noticed and with the distraction of Corrina’s new bust he knew all eyes would be much higher up than his current location. The girls danced and he was fascinated to watch the fluid and sexy motions of Tiffani from his new vantage point. At one stage she teased him by rubbing very close into her friend bringing their two bodies into contact for a few seconds. It was obvious to Zal that Tiffani had become a very unique woman as no one compared with her height not even the tallest of the giants he could see close to her. The evening went off well as the girls enjoyed dancing with a few breaks to rest. In one such interval Zal was upon the shoulder of Corrina as they all sat chatting and he was hidden in her long hair when a man approached Tiffani. It was the first real giant that Zal had seen close up and he didn’t much care for men at this size they looked far too dangerous.  
“So ladies what does a guy have to do to get a dance with a pair of gorgeous angels like you two?”  
The man was trying to act cool and stood casually with his drink in hand smiling and flirting as best he could to both Tiffani and Corrina.  
“Oh you have to be taller to dance with us im afriad”  
Tiffani grinned  
“you certainly look very leggy sat there but I think you’ll find im tall enough at six foot one, how tall do you like your men?”  
A confident replay came back as he stood up proudly in a challenging type of way.  
“six foot one, that short , oh dear perhaps next time when you’ve grown a little”  
The girls laughed at his expense but he didn’t get the joke.  
“Im sure im big enough for you little lady”  
He wasn’t deterred and continued his advance  
“little lady..”  
Tiffani repeated with a burst of laughter almost spilling her drink  
“I can only dance with a guy if he can look me in the eyes”  
“well stand up then sweetheart and we’ll soon see”  
Tiffani slowly rose from her chair stretching out her long legs with the high heeled boots upon them and confronted the stranger. His face was one of shock and surprise as this blonde bombshell towered over him leaving his eye level little above her breasts.  
“oh um err…geez your big”  
He stuttered looking up  
“the little lady isn’t so little any more?”  
Tiffani said loving this feeling as she intimidated him  
“perhaps we’ll have a rain check on that dance eh legs?”  
The man suddenly lost his forward attitude and sloped off towards the bar. As Tiffani sat back down the girls burst out laughing at his expense.  
The evening continued with many such encounters as Tiffani enjoyed experiencing life from a totally new perspective and loved the attention her new body was generating.  
When they returned to the dance floor Zal was similarly positioned as before with his head rising over the band of Corrina’s skirt as she dance only this time the girls didn’t notice as he began to slip down under the skirt. Zal had lost his grip due to the rapid motions of Corrina’s body and found himself falling. He twisted around and tried to grab on to the pink panties as they flashed past his eyes but the vertical silk surface was like ice and there was no grip to be found! He fell out of the bottom of the skirt and as her thighs came rushing past on either side he feared he would be killed from the fall. By sheer luck he landed on Corrina’s soft leather hand bag below that she was dancing around and it gave to his body bouncing him onto the floor behind Corrina. He lept to his feet rushing to keep a distance from the back of Corrina’s huge high heels as they crashed down onto the floor beside him. But no sooner had he avoided this hazard another set of womens shoes many times bigger than him crashed down before him and would have crushed him if it wasn’t for an agile flip he made in the opposite direction. He looked up and all he observed from the floor was a world of giant shoes , mainly women’s shoes and all of them dangerously moving in random motions. The vibration on the hard floor was incredible and he felt the tremors travelling up his legs and body. Zal turned to run back to Corrina but he could no longer even see her! The swarm of women dancing had tightened and he was a little disoriented to where they may have moved. Shouting up was futile and he wanted nothing more than to get away from the dance floor and away from the potential life threatening giant shoes that confronted him on all sides. For once he was scared , he had never felt so vulnerable as he did right now at the feet of these earth women especially looking across at the forest of limbs that towered over him which he had to traverse through to reach relative safety. As Zal sprinted upon his tiny legs the women above had no clue to his presence. At one stage on this perilous journey a stiletto heel twice as tall as he was just missed him but the force of it striking the floor buckled his knees because of his proximity. He found himself rolling on his side to avoid the heel as it shifted this way and that. The thought of becoming impaled by it was very high in his mind and set his heart racing. Then seconds later an opportunity to escape the madness of this environment presented itself. a woman wearing some boot leg cut jeans walked over his location and he managed to grab hold of some frayed strands of thread that touched the floor from the back of the left jean leg. Dragged like a cowboy behind a horse he slid along the ground and although it was uncomfortable his suit protected him from any friction burns. The woman walked straight off the dance floor and into the female toilets and Zal let go as he saw the terrain alter to some cold white tiles and he tried to scrabble under the cover of a sink vanity unit.  
“Hey Carol, what was that on your jeans?”  
A loud female voice boomed from above and Zal suddenly looked meekly up as he saw the woman he had hitched a ride with standing directly before him with another giantess close by.  
“I told you Tonia no more cocktails because im starting to see little men cowering at my feet”  
Zal realised the girls seemed under the influence of alcohol by the slightly slurry manor that they spoke in , he recalled once or twice he chatted with Tiffani and she was under the same condition on those occasions.  
“Wow he’s so little , we are like giants to him ….hello down there little man….”  
The view was daunting for Zal, he was pretty much cornered these two women with the wall of the vanity unit behind his back. They were both visibly older than Tiffani and Corrina perhaps in their late twenties. Tonia was a pretty red head with a slim frame that was squeezed into a short black mini dress, Carol on the other hand was a tall raven haired woman with a larger and more curvy figure. She wore some white jeans and a leather black leather top. Both of these strangers seemed intrigued by his presence and very unpredictable given the fact that they both were under the effects of alcohol.  
Zal instinctively backed away along the wall.  
“Tonia I think he’s trying to look up your dress”  
“here you go little man feast your eyes on this…”  
Tonia proceeded to loom over Zals position and shifted her legs apart in a wide stance. Zal couldn’t help but look up and received an eyeful as he realized she was wearing nothing beneath.  
“He is just so dam little, can you image what you could do with a man this small Carol?”  
“could I? I could step on him and squash him like a bug…”  
Carol raised her foot and hovered rather unsteadily the enormous sole of her giant boot hanging it in the air only several of Zal’s feet above his head. Luckily this was a only to taunt him and she stumbled back a little as he sighed with relief.  
“No we don’t want to kill him , think of the fun we could have…hell if my Jim was that small Idd teach him to pleasure me properly that’s for sure”  
“Come on lets pick him up and have a closer look”  
“no!”  
Zal shouted out looking for places to run. His options were limited no where to his left hand side or right and no retreating. As Tonia leaned down he ran under and between Carols boots. Hearing loud footfalls on the tiles behind him he was no match for their giant strides. Suddenly out of no where one black court shoe blocked his path. It was Tonia and her hands were now following him as he sped of to avoid her shoe. Zal saw the expanse of a huge palm as it came to halt his progress as effectively as any wall. Then he felt the other hand brush behind his back as four fingers wrapped their length around his whole body and he was captured with relative ease.  
“Ive got you little man!”  
“Come on Tonia lets see him!”  
Zal was tumbled out onto the cold surface of the metal vanity shelf below a mirror and so high up he had no chance to jump and no method of escape. The two giant faces closed in on him and he stepped back.  
“please , let me go, you don’t understand”  
“that’s so cute did you hear his voice!”  
”like a toy, wow he is so small! I could fit him in my purse”  
“or in your underwear Tonia”  
They laughed  
“well if you wore any that is”  
Another laughing session commenced as Carol prodded a finger towards Zal.  
“I don’t think you would last five minutes with big girls like us eh little man…so how did you get so small?”  
He didn’t answer  
“I bet he’s some experiment some government thing you know like x files”  
“Please ladies put me back down I need to find my girlfriend”  
“did you hear that Tonia his girlfriend ..who’s that tumbellina?”  
Zal knew any reasoning with them was impossible  
“Carol I think he is staring at your tits girl”  
“want some of these do you little man, I don’t think you can handle them they’re way bigger than you are…”  
Carol leaned closer and offered a view deep into the considerable cleavage she had forced from into her leather sleeveless top.  
“Infact I could crush you between these…hey Tonia how long do you think he’d last in between these”  
Zal was picked up between Carols fingers and unceremoniously dropped into her heaving bosom. He landed in her cleavage and bounced down into its firm embrace an inch or so below the top. Panicking he tried to get out as Carol laughed.  
“oh this is too much just look at him in there that’s so funny!”  
“he’s so dinky you could suffocate him in there”  
“maybe I will”  
The walls of breast flesh , rather hot and sweaty breast flesh closed in on Zal. He braced them with his arms but they kept closing in. Soon he was enveloped and the walls kept compacting around him. He was no longer able to move anything and his breathing was becoming rapidly restricted. Just when he thought it was all over, the pressure subsided as two fingers pulled him out.  
”that’s just a taster of women power little man”  
Carol smirked and dangled him between by the back of his suit in mid air pinching the material in her nails.  
“You think he’s worth something Tonia?”  
“maybe , we could be rich , we could own the worlds smallest man”  
“please! What have I done to you , wont you please let me go. My girlfriend will be looking for me…you don’t realise…”  
Before Zals pleading could finish Carol talked straight over him effectively drowning out his words with her far more powerful voice.  
”Hey Tonia , why would any girl go out with someone so small , his whole body is tinier than my Dave’s dick when its soft!”  
“maybe she uses him in other ways .Hey lets see something…”  
Tonia went into her handbag as Zal heard the rustling behind him and cringed at what would happen next. Carol moved him and then he was dropped again. Expecting to fall he shut his eyes but immediately opened them to find he was saved by a translucent red material that now contained him. He fell to the bottom and looked up to find it was suspended by Tonia. They had placed him inside a fresh condom.  
“oh that hilarious! I don’t think it fits him do you!!Ha, ha!!”  
Zal wasn’t sure what they had placed him inside but knew he didn’t want to be trapped in there.  
“Hey Carol shall we take him back in to the club and play with him I need a another drink”  
  
##Part 21  
  
“Why not he’s our now aren’t you little man”  
“Actually he’s mine, hand him over bitch!”  
The two women turned around they hadn’t noticed anyone enter the room and then both of them had to look up, way up. All seven foot two of a very angry looking blonde towered over them both with her arms resting on her hips and her green eyes blazing.  
“um yeh sure, what ever……you say”  
Carol meekly handed the condom over to Tiffani as she in turn gave them both a hard stare and watched them leave. Crawling out of the condom onto the familiar palm of his girlfriends hand Zal saw her face transform from the aggressive look she had given the two women to her normal loving smile.  
“Oh Zal Im so sorry you must have been through hell baby. Im so glad I found you”  
She rubbed him next to her cheek and he could see the formations of large tears welling in her eyes.  
“Im ok Tiffani a bit shaken that was some experience I went through but you saved me just in time, how did you know I was here?”  
“I didn’t but Corrina’s still out there searching for you its pure luck I walked in to check the toilets when I heard her talking to you. Come on baby let me put you back in my boobs where your safe ok?”  
There was no argument from Zal, he was lovingly slipped back into the safety of Tiffani’s breasts as she went back to find her friend. The three of them not long after made their way back to Tiffani’s house. When they entered the house the answer phone was bleeping so Tiffani instinctively hit the button and let the speaker play the recording….  
“Tiffani its Sue.”  
It was her auntie with a very concerned tone of voice.  
“I guess your out because of your birthday , listen call me straight away when you return its very important about your mother”  
Needless to say Tiffani was on the phone despite the fact that it was approaching one in the morning.  
Zal and Corrina listened on to half the conversation which didn’t sound good. Eventually they began to get the full story from Tiffani as she sat down in the living room with her friend and tiny lover who was stood on the coffee table before them.  
“I cant believe this , how could mum do such a thing? Oh Zal!”  
A sympathetic hand gestured out to Zal but why was she comforting him?  
“we’ve got to stop her!”  
Corrina shook her head and gave a quizzical look at her friend.  
“Listen begin at the start Tiff, what’s going on?”  
A deep breathe later and Tiffani started the tale.  
“Mums been confiding in her sister , auntie Sue. She has been really down recently I guess I just haven’t taken notice I was to wrapped up in my own world. Apparently she suspected for some time that my dads been playing away from home with his secretary Jan. She even went to the extent of hiring a private investigator to catch him out and two days ago the guy she hired came back with some hard evidence , some photo’s I guess. She found out yesterday that Dad isn’t really away on business right now as the conference has ended. Its taken her most of today to find out where my dad is but now she knows this Jan and him are shacked up at that new Regal resort near the city”  
She paused  
“Mums determined to make him pay and catch the two of the out, Sue said she’s on her way there right now, she’s got an hour head start on us”  
“wait a minute Tiff I know this isn’t nice for you what with your parents and that but don’t get involved let them sort it out”  
Corrina comforted her friend with a hand on her knee.  
“No there’s more, she told Sue about Zal and how she pretended to be me the other night and stole him away.”  
“She did?”  
Zal wasn’t convinced  
“in the night she took you and drugged you Zal that’s why you don’t remember and that’s why you felt so bad in the morning…Zal apparently she had every little drop inside you she could get by using you and she’s put it all in a little vial ready to take when she meets up with Dad. Sue said she’s mad and hell bent on revenge and getting back at him and if my auntie was right and she has that much of your stuff Zal then she’s gonna cause some serious damage”  
“my god that’s crazy she’ll grow like mad!”  
“Corrina we have got to stop her, I have got to stop her before that happens.”  
”Wait a minute your auntie believed all this about Zal with no evidence?”  
“Sue said mum is already 7 foot six now she barely got her legs behind her steering wheel”  
“I am so sorry Tiffani it wasn’t for me this…”  
Zal began to apologize but he was stopped in mid sentence as Tiffani continued.  
”Its not your fault you didn’t know this would happen, my mother is filled with jealously and god knows what emotions right now she isn’t thinking straight. I cant forgive her for taking advantage of you again especially in such a despicable manor getting you off your head with some drug, but she’s anti-men at the moment and you were an easy target. She’s wanting revenge on my dad and nothing is gonna stop her unless I do.”  
“You mean we”  
Zal offered boldly stepping forward to the side of the coffee table.  
“Zal is there any way of knowing what effect a large amount of your sperm would have on her?”  
He pondered on the question and then reached into his leg pocket for a com-link to the ship. Using a remote link he accessed the science and medical database offering some statistics to the computer as best he could.  
“Is he working out something I cant see that little device is it like a pda or something?”  
Corrina peered down but Zal was absorbed.  
“Well, I cant be sure how much she managed to get from me into that vial and according to the probability from the computers hypothesis function the more exposure to raytron based on what little we know about its effect on earth humans it could accelerate the growth dramatically but this is only a probability”  
“I don’t like the sound of that”  
Corrina remarked  
“me neither, we have to get to my mother before she is foolish enough to drink that stuff because once she does there is no turning back and im worried what damage she will do to my dad right or wrong”  
“We can take my mums MPV she lets me drive it , im insured and im probably just inside the limit”  
“great so lets head out to the Resort and see if we can catch her in time, you go and grab the car and we’ll meet back here ok”  
Their plans were set into action, Zal continued to use the small device in his hand whilst Tiffani disappeared upstairs for a short while. When she returned Zal had some good news.  
“Tiffani if you drop me off at my ship on the way I think that my scanners can be finely calibrated to detect Raytron traces which on this planet should limit things to my ship, the com-crystals, you , me and Corrina. If I filter out the things we know the location of then your mother would be the only thing left”  
“Brilliant we can track her down!”  
“Zal whilst Corrina isn’t here I have been thinking its my responsibility to stop mum and if she does begin to grow that’s gonna be even tougher unless we are prepared for it”  
“What are you saying?”  
Tiffani opened up a huge palm to display a small vial in the centre.  
“This was in mums room in a pack I think we should try and fill it”  
Zal knew what this meant and Tiffani’s eyes look determined to do what ever it took to resolve things.  
“Zal if mum had you for a few hours how capable would you Tallions be?”  
“Tiffani, I hate to say it but given reason to rise we Tallions especially in our prime like me can make love many, many times even between the burning when we actually need release”  
“Then here are a couple of reasons to rise”  
She lowered her breasts in the tight white dress towards him and offered him a sensational view of her cleavage, Zal knew what he had to do. With Tiffani’s assistance he took himself to the point of no return and captured his seed in the vial. They managed another small deposit before Corrina pulled up outside and Zal was taken into the 7 seater vehicle.  
“whats that in your hand?”  
Corrina questioned as the buckled into the seat beside her.  
“Oh im just taking precautions incase mum gets out of control”  
“No don’t Tiff that could be dangerous”  
“Corrina my mum could be dangerous to a lot of people, she’s mad right now and I wouldn’t want to be any man that got in her way but someone needs to measure up to her and that should be me”  
The trio sped off to the landing site of Zals ship and parked as close as possible. As he entered the ship the two giantess outside picked it up and carried it between them like a small stretcher. Zal couldn’t believe their strength but his craft in reality wasn’t that heavy it was just an awkward shape. He sat in his command chair and accessed his computer to set up the tracking they desired. By the time his ship had been placed in the rear load compartment of the MPV he left down the boarding ramp to be greeted by Tiffani’s waiting hands.  
“Any news Zal?”  
“Well she is 50 of your miles north east from here if I read things correctly and travelling very slowly”  
“She’s taken the minor roads and not the toll by the sounds of it we could make up some real time if we get on the faster roads”  
Tiffani smiled there was hope of getting there in time.  
“Corrina are you ok driving whilst I stay in the back here and well erm attend to my boyfriend”  
“sure”  
For the next best part of an hour Tiffani concentrated on making Zal cum as many times as she could manage. He spent time with his legs and body half immersed in her hot mouth as her tongue set about stimulating him. At other times she had let him play on her breasts and nipples and rubbed his naked body up against her womanhood. Needless to say Zal was enjoying the journey but he was always aware that there was a more serious purpose to their activities as the vial began to slowly fill. With Zal exhausted Tiffani was surprised how amazing his sexual prowess was realizing that she had made him spend and replenish his load five times in less than an hour a feat any man on her planet would never be able to do in such a short timescale and in such quantity, Tallions were certainly remarkable.  
“Well I think your just about drained, any more in there little lover?”  
“Im beat that was everything, but we must be nearly there. I will check the readings for your mother and pin point her”  
They arrived at the Resort which was a very large hotel and very new. It stood in its own impressive grounds as it was fashioned to look like an ancient stone castle complete with turrets a moat and draw bridge. Having been built only ten years ago it caused quite a stir and was the “in” place to stay for something a little different by the coast yet close enough to the city centre. Inside his ship Zal found Sandy’s signal it was less than a quarter of a mile away and static. He got out of the ship and into Tiffani’s hand.  
“She’s close , very close perhaps you should proceed on foot from here.”  
“Is she in the resort inside the castle walls?”  
Corrina parked the car looking outside and up towards the imposing walls of the fake castle.  
“No, she is the grounds in that direction not moving”  
Zal was currently upon Tiffani’s shoulder and pointed into the parking area that was shrouded by a dense tree line. They walked towards where he had gestured and Tiffani spotted her mothers vehicle. You two wait here I need to do this alone. Depositing Zal into the warm comfort of Corrina’s breasts she left them and wandered over to the car. Even from a distance Tiffani could tell her mother was taller as her blonde head of hair stood out far higher than the small window screen of the convertible she drove, it was fortunate that she didn’t have a roof to squeeze under. Her mother was on the mobile phone.  
“Just tell me if he is in this turret room or not”  
She seemed to be in an argument and clearly trying to locate her husband to surprise him.  
“So if he isn’t there he may be on this champagne night cruiser is that a fact…and where does this excursion go exactly…..mmm really so it will be back in ten minutes that’s excellent”  
“Mother?”  
Tiffani walked over to her and made her jump a little.  
“Tiffani?”  
She looked shocked to see her daughter and put down the phone instantly.  
“Your auntie I suppose , she shouldn’t have told you I don’t want you here …just leave ok”  
“But mother your being irrational , if dads gone off with some floozy let him go , divorce him whatever but don’t do anything you will regret”  
“Tiffani, he’s made me look stupid, he’s been getting his leg over this tart for over a year. Yes over a year and I was so stupid not to have seen it earlier. Well I don’t care why he did it but he is going to pay! Im going to get the respect I deserve from your father if it’s the last thing I do”  
“Mother , aunt Sue told me about the vial you have”  
“Then you know you don’t want to be around here then don’t you when I drink this”  
She produced the small vial from her glove compartment and held it before her.  
“I wont let you mother its madness your not thinking straight”  
“Oh but I am Tiff I see clearly now all men deserve to bow to us women, they think they can do just about anything they want , well now I have the power to prove that isn’t the case Im gonna humiliate your father like he has me and you my dear should keep out of it and besides…..”  
The car door opened and a long, long leg the likes of which Tiffani had never set eyes upon before seemed to almost unravel from its restricted position and lowered to the floor with a bare foot. Sandy stepped out as gracefully as she could manage but the car was very cramped for her new legs.  
“…I don’t think your gonna be able to stop me Tiff”  
The challenging statement passed her lips as Sandy stood up to confront her daughter. Despite her seven foot two stature in her heels Tiffani was looking up to her mother who was several inches taller in bare feet! She was wearing what Tiffani recognised as one of her fathers white work shirts and it was like a mini-dress on her and barely covering her rear end.  
“Mother what have you done to yourself?”  
  
##Part 22  
  
“Yes im strikingly tall now aren’t I? Thought it would add to my entrance as I burst in on your father and that gold digging little trollop of a secretary. Only Im not sure if he’s making out with her up in that castle or sipping champagne and laughing at me on some posh boat that’s due here any second….either way I think I deserve a few more inches don’t you?”  
Sandy pulled a small cork out of the vial and held it close to her lips.  
“No mother think about what that stuff could do to you!”  
“Oh I am Tiff, haven’t you felt the rush of being taller. How powerful it makes you feel? How confident? I don’t just want your father to look up to me I want him to be frightened of me and that means Ive got to get bigger much bigger!”  
Tiffani lunged forward to grab the vial but her mother simply raised her arm high in the air way beyond the reach of her daughter.  
“I don’t think so Tiff its time you stepped aside, Mummy’s got to have room to grow”  
Throwing her head back and mouth open she poured the tiny amount of liquid into her mouth and waited. Tiffani stepped back and waited for the inevitable to occur. It was slow at first, Sandy felt the shirt tighten around her bust and then the buttons pop one by one as her chest and body challenged it from within. Like a female version of the hulk she ripped out of her clothes and now completely naked she started to acquire several extra feet in height. Tiffani watched astounded as her mothers waist then navel rose level to her eyes and in seconds she was looking straight at her mother sex followed by her thighs that began to tower up into the heavens.  
“Oh yes this feels soooo good!”  
Corrina came running to the side of her friend to pull her back which nearly through Zal from her breasts as they wobbled up and down.  
“Tiff get back here!”  
They all stood in awe of her mother who had exceeded 50foot tall and was on her way to eighty feet tall. Sandy was surprised herself how massive she was becoming but was loving every extra foot she obtained. Soon the trees only came to her thighs and Sandy pushed her way through them forcing them back as she strode with purpose out to the beach area.  
“She’s a giantess!”  
Tiffani declared  
“I don’t believe it!”  
“She’s still growing”  
Zal added glad he wasn’t at the mercy of the new Sandy although he was pretty sure she was so colossal now that he would but a dust particle to her. Sandy felt the tree branches snapping like twigs around her knees as she strode through and onto the beach. Her bare feet sunk into the sand making huge depressions as she looked across the moon lit bay in search of the late night cruiser on its return.  
On the Carobal cruiser some very merry party goers filled the exposed upper deck feeling the wind in their hair as the boat sailed along hugging the shore line offering its passengers the delights of the city lights in the distance and the perfect view of the moon gliding its beams over the surface of the ocean. The chinking of glasses was a common sound along with the subtle music and the wine was flowing well. Tiffani’s father Paul was one of the jubilant passengers sat with his arm around a young and very pretty brunette at his side.  
“Oh Paul, this is how it should be just you and me. When we get back tomorrow night will you tell her its over? Will you tell her your mine now?”  
“Its not that easy, she can be difficult and she is so very……big!”  
“What? Did you say big?”  
Pauls mouth fell open as he gawped forward and high above the boat. Stood in the deep water as it lapped around her knees was Sandy. A gigantic Sandy who loomed over the boat in her full naked glory, the moonlight danced upon her curves as she smiled down at the toy sized boat making its way between her towering thighs as she became a human bridge. The captain of the boat was in shock he didn’t alter course infact he did nothing but stare at the incredible sight of a giant woman straddling his boat as they passed under her. The rest of the crew and passengers just looked up with similar expressions of disbelief as the largest female sex they had ever witnessed hung over their heads as the tip of the boats tall masts barely missed it.  
“enjoying the view boys?”  
Her voice shattered the stillness of the night sky as the boat sailed gently between two gargantuan thighs that rose like cliff faces aside the small vessel. Paul immediately stood up on the deck and spun around to look at the enormous and yet so familiar pert bottom that now hovered high above him in the sky in the wake of the boat. He was dumfounded and couldn’t comprehend that this was reality as the giant form of his naked wife turned around in the water sending ripples that unsettled the boat as she did so. The rest of the passengers began to scream and panic and most of them scrabbled to the lower decks inside for what little protection they perceived it offering. All except Paul and his partner who were frozen to the spot.  
“tell me this isn’t happening Paul. Tell me that isn’t your wife up there!”  
Jan shouted at Paul and he just looked at her in a daze.  
“This isn’t happening! This isn’t happening! She’s huge! Im dreaming , yes dreaming that’s it!”  
Paul refused to trust his eyes as he watched his wife close in on the ship with one mighty step that showered the boats deck and himself in a wave of salty spray.  
“oh my god she’s going to sink us!”  
Jan was in a panic now as she realised the true potential of the enormous limbs wading through the water closing in on the comparatively tiny ship.  
“Paul do something! Say something to her!”  
Clutching Pauls now soaked shirt she positioned herself behind him and cowered in the presence of the giantesses view.  
“Sandy, please stop don’t step on the boat! Please!”  
Sandy could now see her tiny husband waving his arms frantically on the deck, the boat to her looked like an elaborate child’s toy and she couldn’t get over just how small everything appeared to her now, she felt like a goddess of the sea with the little mortals at her mercy down by her feet. Sandy leaned forward and Paul backed off as two tremendous breasts fell over the deck smashing down on plastic moulded seats and railings as she placed two arms around the boat and her hands gripped under the hull.  
All the occupants of the craft lurched and fell over as the boat was lifted clean from the water with its engines still humming. Paul and Jan grabbed hold of some railings nearby as Sandy laughed at their plight and then she walked the ship over to the land.  
Meanwhile Tiffani was facing a major dilemma.  
“Look at what she is doing!”  
“Tiff, don’t do it , don’t take that stuff you’ll never be normal sized again!”  
Corrina begged her friend as she looked thoughtfully at the vial in her hands.  
“But I have to stop her before she hurts someone , before she hurts my father”  
The mpv they all sat in rocked as a giant pair of feet wandered past clipping a few cars in the process and denting them. Sandy headed for a clearing to the side of the castle structure and set the boat down pushing its hull into the soft earth so it would stand upright. Her laugh boomed out as she witnessed the small passengers jumping overboard and climbing down off the sides of the ship to escape , some of the women screaming as they did so. There was a growing noise from the castle area as lights in the windows came on and people looked out at the science fictional scene of this giantess stood naked towering over people as they ran for their lives. Cries of “a giantess!, it’s a giant woman!” and drunken male wolf whistles filled the air much to the amusement of Sandy at the reaction she was causing. Paul helped Jan climb down the side of the boat to the grass below whilst Sandy move closer.  
“Awww and to think you used to hold me in your arms like that Paul”  
Her giant amplified voice began a sarcastic tone  
“but not anymore eh honey, im a bit too much woman for you now”  
Paul was aware of her giant presence behind him but concentrated on getting Jan down safely, when the couple stood on the grass together they turned to see Sandy in a dominant pose her hands resting on her curvy hips as she peered over her enormous breasts in order to see them.  
“You look like such an insect Paul, still you were never big where it counted were you….Never enough to satisfy a real woman like me”  
“Leave us alone you…you freak!”  
Jan angrily reacted and instantly regretted her outburst.  
“Freak?”  
A large foot bigger than a family estate car crashed down several feet before Jan and Paul pushing its sole deep into the terrain and making the both of them fall to their knees  
with the sheer impact.  
“You know I was jealous of you Jan how pretty you are and what a nice figure you have but now Im beyond all that because your nothing but a little pathetic doll to me now”  
Sandy leaned down and reached out an enormous hand brushing Paul aside with the flick of a casual finger as she closed in on Jan. Jan screamed and began to run from the hand that followed her a hand so wide that she couldn’t see over it , a hand so wide that she couldn’t escape it. In seconds four large fingers the thickness of telegraph poles wrapped around her and captured completely. Helpless Paul look on winded by the finger that had brushed his stomach. Standing back up Sandy opened out her palm flat with Jan upon it at a dangerously high level above the ground but simply at face height to herself.  
“You are pretty for a little doll aren’t you?”  
“Leave, leave me alone! Let me go!”  
A frightened Jan backed across the large palm that suspended her as the fingers curled a little to stop her retreat from behind.  
“careful what you ask for tiny you wouldn’t really want me to let you go from here im considerably leggier than you are and that’s a long way down…”  
Sandy’s spare hand hovered over Jan and a long finger nail prodded at her clothes. She was wearing a loose white blouse and Sandy slide a finger nail inside ripping it open.  
Jan was petrified now with her breasts expose under the scrutiny of this giant woman and completely at her mercy. Her hands tried to fend off the finger that was so easily stripping her but all of her power proved unable to force any resistance at all.  
“My Paul always was a bit of a breast man and to think I was jealous of this tiny little pair…look Paul she’s nothing I can hardly see her little tits , how could you ever dare compare them to mine. These are real tits!”  
Sandy thrust Jan towards her cleavage covering her tiny body as she was positioned between them.  
“you see Paul, there is no competition anymore my nipples are bigger than both of her little tits put together!”  
“Sandy put her down! Please don’t hurt her!”  
Paul plucked up courage enough to walk up to Sandy’s huge bare toes on her left foot and he struck his fist down on them as hard as he could to grab the giantesses attention. It was a foolish move and one that was likely to anger her yet due to her size he managed only to strike the top of the toe nail and hurt his hand in the process.. Sandy heard his words but didn’t feel his aggressive actions at all!  
“You care for her do you Paul? I cant see what she has to offer you , really I cant. These insignificant boobs, these little skinny match stick legs….”  
Sandy pulled away Jan’s skirt like a small piece of tissue. She was almost naked now and clinging to Sandy’s thumb as a giant finger continued to prod her and move her about.  
“no please! Im sorry he’s yours I don’t want him, please don’t hurt me”  
Jan cried pathetically desperate to be anywhere but in the clutches of her lovers giant wife.  
“What are you talking about you silly little insect he isn’t yours to give up, he’s mine and he’s always been mine and I will decide his future now which wont include you”  
“Mother put her down this instant!”  
Tiffani had run over towards her father but Sandy simply picked her up and placed her onto of the castle battlements. It was dizzy experience for Tiffani to be held and moved at such a fast rate of ascent and totally disorienting to be placed on the castle walls.  
“mother!”  
She called but Sandy moved away stranding Tiffani who would have to find her way out of the castle now and back to the ground by conventional methods.  
“So where was I ? Oh yes I was deciding if I should punish and make an example of you my little pretty but first I think its my husband and I that need to talk so you can hang around until im ready to deal with you”  
Sandy walked to the castle and lifted the practically naked Jan high up to the top of a turret which only reached her stomach. Her giant fingers broke off a section of the wall below and she filled the exit from the turret ensuring Jan couldn’t escape due to the tons of rubble she had effectively dropped. Sandy laughed and turned her attention to her husband. Paul was in full sprint towards the safety of the castle by the time Sandy saw him he was almost at the edge of the moat and running for the draw bridge. Inside the entrance a gathering of staff and people staying in the resort beckoned him to hurry so they could elevate the bridge.  
Tiffani meanwhile had made it back to the mpv and was totally out of breath.  
“Give me the vial Corrina there is no reasoning with her I have to protect everyone”  
Zal looked up from his current position upon Corrina’s lap and tried to dissuade her.  
Sandy stomped after Paul.  
“you cant escape me little man, your mine now Paul , all mine”  
Way off in the distance Police sirens began to wail and Sandy who was now so toweringly tall that she could be seen for miles around in the clear nights sky laughed to herself knowing they would be powerless to stop her when they arrived. Paul cleared the replica wooden draw bridge across the large moat and just in time as he felt the vibrations of Sandy’s footfalls behind him. The bridge was then pulled up by the modern day electric motors. He was greeted by strangers a mix of curious and scared people inside who wanted to help him but also wanted to know what on earth was going on.  
“Oh Paul you disappoint me darling , you should know by now that I never give up if I want something badly enough. I suggest you come out of that little castle right now or im coming in after you”  
There was no reply.  
“Paul do you really want to anger a giantess like me? Do you really appreciate how big I am now , how powerful this body of mine has become?”  
There was still silence except for in the MPV only a few hundred feet away.  
“Corrina please give me the vial I’ve made my decision I know what I am doing here!”  
As Corrina continued to sanity check her friend Sandy was beginning to become destructive.  
“Paul this is my last warning are you coming out or do I have to fetch you myself?”  
Another silence as Paul sat only a few metres away from the inside of the draw bridge thankful he was out of sight. Sandy knelt down in order to get closer to the draw bridge and reached one huge arm across the moat and forcefully knocked on the closed wooden structure as if it was a small door. Her mighty fist easily buckled the metal fastenings that pivoted the door and the impression of her hand could be seen from the other side as the wood pushed inwards with a large creaking and snapping sounds.  
“Knock , knock , guess who?”  
She laughed at how easy this drawbridge gave to her strength and holding out her palm flat she pushed it inwards. The drawbridge seemed to explode into small fragments of wood and now there was a huge gap. Stunned the people inside dived for cover as the shrapnel of wooden fragments filled the air. Paul dared to look at the huge hole revealed and there was a massive face looking back at him with a huge knowing smile.  
“peek a boo!”  
Sandy almost blew her words of surprise through the arch shaped gap and Paul felt how close she was.  
“better run tiny”  
He heard these words as she stretched out a hand and it entered into the castle through the arch. Large finger nails just missed his back as she achieved the full length of her reach but Paul felt the wind from her snatching action. He was scared now.  
Sandy stood back up a little frustrated by her lost attempt to grab him and then moved closer. Onlookers on the battlements that had come to stare looked on in wonder as she closed towards them. All they could see was her terrific mountainous breasts as they wobbled without restraint and then her navel as it lined up with this section of the wall.  
“better move little ones before the goddess crushes you”  
Her warning didn’t need to be repeated and there was a mass exodus from the walkways as Sandy elegantly stepped over the moat and lifted herself on her arms so her huge backside balanced on the wall. It sunk a little and cracked in several places from her weight as Sandy lifted her legs up and over the battlement wall in a lady like fashion. Now she was stood inside the small castle grounds! Her eyes searched for Paul and found him as he just disappeared under a large mini bus trying desperately to hide.  
Sandy leaned down and simply lifted the mini bus up in one hand , her fingers denting the panels either side of it making huge impressions. Inspecting the mini bus for a second she grinned at her strength and tossed it aside making it crash down on its roof against a wall. Paul was exposed and could see his giant wife towering over him and a look of victory in her eyes. A tremendous foot fell aside him and then another until he was almost squashed in the gap between them. Looking up all he could see was her legs and the underside of her breasts like curved overhangs above. He wriggled out of the hold her feet made on his body and scrabbled on top of her right foot before he ran along it and jumped several feet down heading for a door. Sandy knelt down allowing him freedom to run. As he almost reached the door she simply reached forward and over him and slammed the side of a hand to block the door completely from his view. He turned but it was too late her hand now closed back in on him and he was soon in her possession.  
“got you!”  
She smiled and felt him squirming in her hand, it was so effortless for her to contain him in a fist and the rush of excitement filled her at how easy it would be to crush such a man inside it. Lifting him to her face she opened her hand and secured him by picking him up with the scruff of his shirt neck only. Pauls legs dangled free and it was a long drop below.  
  
##Part 23  
  
“well Paul what have you to say for yourself?”  
“i…im ssorry darling”  
He pathetically whimpered conscious of her huge white teeth as they moved several feet away from him. Although she was undeniably pretty at this scale the thought of a mouth as big as hers was also terrifying because of the size of those teeth he could see behind her gigantic lips.  
“not good enough you puny little insect. Are you scared Paul?”  
She made him come closer to her eyes with eyeballs larger than his head reflecting his expression of fear. She looked at him almost quaking in her presence and knew she was enjoying this and wished he would try and put up some resistance so she could overpower him.  
“I would be scared if I was you Paul because im so much bigger than you now”  
“Sandy…please I”  
A huge finger raised before him and gestured that his sentence should end right there he then helplessly watched it descend with its long manicured nail to be joined by a thumb nail. His trousers were then ripped free which hurt him a little as the material succumb to her nails tugging at them. Next the same nail of that finger which was nearly as wide as his waist pulled down his boxers and his flaccid manhood hung free.  
“I must need glasses, no a magnifying glass to see that excuse for a prick you have down there”  
She grinned as she lifted him closer to her mouth so her breathe exhaled across him as she spoke  
“say goodbye to it Paul because ive decided to bite it off a fitting punishment for your betrayal, I could turn you into a woman in one bite”  
Unable to move away his genitals and flaccid length were moved into her mouth and now his male equipment laid across the top of her lower front teeth as her menacingly large pearly white upper teeth descended and held themselves in position to snap shut. Pauls body was visibly shaking he was half inside her mouth a mouth large enough to eat him, the lips he once recalled that had kissed his own now settled across his lower thighs and chest and he could do nothing to stop her. Sandy offered some pressure and he felt the teeth begin to clamp down upon his flesh. Now he had lost himself in fear completely.  
Sandy lifted him out just as the teeth snapped together with a loud crunch of the enamel and missed him by inches! Paul uncontrollably felt himself release in fright as  
urine trickled down his legs and dripped off of his dangling feet.  
“now your scared”  
Sandy laughed at his reaction the feeling of control and power wonderfully surging within her.  
Zal was in his ship he had requested Tiffani to hold on before swallowing the vial.  
As he emerged he held up a modified version of the Tiffani’s com crystal.  
“Zal hurry what is it you wanted me to have?”  
“This”  
He presented the crystal it looked the same to her except it had a small black patch on its exterior.  
“as you get larger place this in your ear the pad will bond to anything and it will stop direct contact with your skin so no raytron exposure, we wouldnt want your ear growing. Ive added an artificial amplifier strip to the pad it will boost the audio so you can hear me because once you begin to grow ill be nothing but a spec to you my goddess Tiffani”  
“Oh Zal I hadn’t thought about that …if I grow like my mother did I don’t think I will be able to see you , this maybe the last time we are close”  
“I know and im sorry this all happened I cant help feeling ….”  
“Zal save it I don’t want apologies baby I want to remember a loving look on your face”  
“Tiffani I will do my uppermost to reverse this believe me I will , I shall work with every scientific mind on my planet until I do”  
Tiffani wrapped a hand around him and lifted him to her lips and with an enormous kiss he was then tucked into the cleavage of her now buxom friend.  
“Now you stay with Corrina she’ll protect you now”  
Not far away from this touching scene Sandy had climbed out of the castle and now made off for a clearing visible only to a giantess of her size as it was off in the distance. She walked away striding easily over the police cars that had just literally arrived and then her attention focused on the poor creature in her hand. A minute later and nearly a cross country mile covered and she paused her journey seeing an old abandoned aircraft hanger that presented itself as a seat for a giantess.  
Sandy sat down and the metal roof panels sighed and sunk with her weight, she opened out her hand and looked at the sorry state of her husband.  
“this is a lot better Paul, just you and me, well actually not so much of you anymore and plenty of me! Oh you should have seen your face when you thought I was going to bite that teeny little thing off between your legs it was classic!”  
Sandy laughed in a movie style evil villainess manor which did little to make Paul any less frightened in her presence, he decided to try and reason with her it was his only choice.  
“Sandy, how did you get this way?”  
”You mean become a giantess? Well that’s my secret Paul but let’s say it was my destiny. I think it rather suits me to be this enormous don’t you?”  
He looked across from her hand and made out just how huge she was , she must have weighed multiple tonnes and based upon his comparative size to her he estimated she was well over two hundred feet tall. What he couldn’t shake off was the size of her body parts, the hand that surrounded him , the face that towered over him and then below that face those two magnificent breasts that simply dwarfed him in size. He recalled how easily his hands used to contain one of her breasts and how his mouth would consume those nipples and most of her flesh with it, but now even her nipples looked larger than his head and thicker than his own body.  
“Yyyyour titanic”  
He couldn’t help but stutter his words as his eyes lingered on to her breasts alone.  
“Titanic , yes I am titanic just look at me Paul and look at little insignificant you in my hand. Even my breasts are bigger than you are……would you like to see them close up Paul my big beautiful giant breasts?”  
Without his response Sandy lifted him onto her neck as she leaned back a little. Releasing him she felt his tiny body slide down her skin towards the wide mouth of her waiting bosom. She pushed her breasts together just as he entered the top of her cleavage valley and Paul was smothered in tons of warm womanly flesh. At first it was pleasurable he forgot for a second that she had been threatening him and found himself enjoying the sensation of being body deep in her breasts surrounded by her sexy giant orbs. But suddenly that feeling subsided as he found it difficult to draw breathe. The pressure of those flesh walls around him squeezed tighter until movement was impossible and the heat became harder and harder to tolerate. He held his last breathe and prayed she would set him free. Sandy laughed and her voice boomed from above.  
“my boobs will be the last thing you feel Paul as they suffocate you a fitting end to your lecherous ways my tiny husband”  
Was she serious? Paul heard the booming yet muffled voice around him and tried to move and wriggle yet he was imprisoned and drowning in her breasts unable to save himself.  
“This is the Police, giant woman release the hostage and put him down on the ground!”  
Sandy looked at the ground below at her feet it was littered with several police vehicles which she hadn’t even noticed. One of the officers shielded by the door of his car was shouting up to her upon a public address system.  
“Oh how precious… toy towns police department has come to the rescue of my doll like husband”  
Sandy stood up to look even more dominating over the tiny men below who barely stood proud of her toes. A portable search light projected a large circle up and over her breasts as she held them together. The light annoyed Sandy who placed a huge foot down upon it and squashed the lighting rig flat as it exploded in an instant. Police men ran in fear as they witnessed the sole of her foot longer and wider than their own cars rising over them and pressing their equipment into the ground. Sandy had a small attack of conscious was she really able to kill her husband so easily? Did he really deserve to die for his crimes of love? She was angry with him and very emotionally volatile but killing him was maybe too easy a way out for him, as a giantess she could make him suffer in other ways there were so many possibilities of how he could be used and forced to please her. Sandy eased up on her breasts allowing them to part enough for him to breathe again. Paul gasped he was completely red in the face and it wasn’t a moment too soon for him to be released.  
“giant woman please place the hostage down and step away or we will use force”  
Her attention diverted again to the ground the Police men had regrouped and some of them even had guns.  
“Oh no, how scary the wittle policey men are gonna shoot my ankles with their ickle pee shooters”  
Her sarcastic baby voice rained down over them but the officers stood their ground and repeated the warning.  
“You men just don’t learn do you? Your looking up at a woman now and you will do as I say and if you don’t loose the guns and show me some respect im gonna use my big weapons starting right now”  
Sandy stomped a nearby empty police car as if it was a small beer can under her left heel. Shocked the officers retreated and one of them fired a shot that stung Sandy below the knee with its bullet. She was angrier now.  
“You are going to regret that you little insects!”  
Whilst this confrontation continued Tiffani had taken the vial and was beginning to grow. Stood outside the MPV she towered over Corrina who barely reached her knee level and she was rising into the nights sky rapidly. Zal was snuggly surrounded by Corrina’s cleavage and his tiny head bent backwards trying to take in the view of Tiffani who was making the giantess that held him seem very small indeed. Tiffani had removed her clothes which was a good thing as nothing could contain her expanding body.  
“Oh god look at her Zal she’s a giant woman!”  
“no you’re a giant woman, Tiffani is beyond a giantess”  
Zal began but realized Tiffani was now so colossal in size that Corrina was barely as tall as her friends big toe! He peered up into the heavens and even in this clear moon lit night he couldn’t see a face, infact he couldn’t see anything but her legs extending into the sky above making them the tallest two structures he had ever seen moving.  
“Zal is this what I look like to you its scary she’s so big”  
Corrina stepped back from the huge menacing bare foot before her.  
“But she looks magnificent right?”  
“she is gorgeous but she also makes me feel scared just being in her presence”  
“you’ll get used to being around a giantess I have and its pretty enjoyable most of the time”  
He smoothed his hands along the inside of the giant boobs that held him and Corrina smiled down into her top acknowledging his point.  
”wow, if this thing blows over it may be fun to let Tiff play with me as big as she is and I would sure like to play on that body of hers..”  
“Hey, Corrina lets see if she can hear me Ill try my Com-crystal. Tiffani can you hear me its Zal?”  
“hey Zal , yes baby I can hear you….”  
Her voice was beyond just loud it shattered the sky above and Corrina held her ears. Fortunately Zal seemed to be immune its was amazingly loud to him but his ears seemed to be protected somehow perhaps due to his alien physiology.  
“erm Tiffani try to speak very softly you just about deafened us down here”  
“Oh sorry”  
With a grand movement they saw Tiffani step back which was quite a sight to see anything so large moving so fast. She then looked down just making out the MPV at her feet and realizing how fantastically tall she had become. Corrina was hardly visible to her.  
“I don’t believe it im like king kong or bigger even I think I overdid it more than a little”  
“You may need the extra feet to pacify your mother Tiffani I suggest you better go over there and see what’s happening”  
“of course Idd better rescue my father , you two wait here where its safe”  
With huge thudding steps they watched her giant body form walk off into the distance her naked form still as intoxicating as ever to them both yet on such a different scale.  
The astonished on lookers in the castle all looked awe struck as a new giantess a beautiful naked giantess of proportions that more than rivaled the other came casually strolling past with her long blonde hair gently trailing down the back of her body like a golden river and her gigantic breasts jiggling uncontrollably with every step.  
Paul had recovered and managed to climb up onto the surface of Sandy’s right breast trying to balance on its enormous expanse and totally fearful of the vast fall should he slide down and drop over the huge nipple below. Sandy was preoccupied with asserting her authority over the police and had begun to nudge police cars tipping them over with nothing but the flicking action of her toes against their sides. The police retreated as they watched this vast woman playing with their vehicles with total disregard as she damaged them. When Sandy had finished she tapped her foot expectantly as she loomed over the tiny men at her feet who were brandishing their guns with a new sense of awareness.  
“This is so easy! I can do anything I want, there isn’t a man on this planet who could stop me”  
Sandy boomed down and laughed heartily feeling the power her new size commanded.  
“But there is a woman who can stop you mother”  
A very loud voice descended over Sandy noticeably deeper and more powerful than her own. Sandy felt the presence of the titaness who had walked up and now towered over her from behind. Before Sandy could turn around to see her daughters magnitude she looked straight up to where the voice came from and saw hanging above her highlighted by the rays of the moon a long taught torso and the underside of two mega sized breasts. Tiffani had just stopped growing and was close to five hundred feet tall! The police down below accessed the new situation as they couldn’t believe this second giantess was actually over twice the stature of the other one but she seemed to be on their side. When Sandy turned her eyes met with her daughters womanhood and she felt like a small child looking up to her own mother. Tiffani gave her mother a look of utter disgust for her actions.  
“Hand over my father right now, give him to me”  
Finding it hard to get over her daughters height Sandy froze uncertain of her own power now as it was overshadowed by the commanding presence of Tiffani.  
“Hand him over now”  
Tiffani crouched and saw the tiniest little man struggling to hold his position on her mothers bare breast and she delicately placed her hand low down so Paul could jump clear. She then raised her father to her face. Paul was in a fantasy land one minute he was floundering to stay atop his wife’s giant breast and now he was in the centre of his daughters hand which was more than just daunting in size. He felt himself rise higher and higher and the wind increase around his body as acres of his daughters curvy body flashed past his vision until her building sized face was partially in view. He focused on her lips as she softly tried to speak down to him.  
“I don’t blame all of this on my mother and im disappointed in you , very disappointed in you father but for now im gonna put you down so you can get yourself and that woman of yours out of our faces before you cause any more trouble.”  
Tiffani leaned way down and covering several fields she placed him back towards the castle and Paul ran off to the lights of the car park in the distance.  
  
##Part 24
  
“As for you mother I think you should calm down and we should go for a little chat”  
Sandy didn’t resist she had to respect her daughter and the two enormous women stepped carefully away into the distance leaving the Police behind…..  
  
The next morning the news of the giant mother and daughter had spread like wildfire. Tiffani had calmed her mother down and the two of them now faced the reality of what they had allowed themselves to become. They had talked through the early hours and a rather tired Tiffani sat on top of a hillside in the midst of the countryside surrounded by the press and authorities that gathered at her feet and that of her mothers beside her. Small helicopters buzzed annoyingly around her face and mid section and she sighed as she looked at the toy sized towns in the distance places she would probably never enter again. Zal had said his goodbyes to Corrina and with his craft now fully operational he had begun to pilot it towards his oversized girlfriend.  
“Tiffani its Zal, I hope you can still hear me I’m coming to bid you farewell my love”  
“Zal I can hear you baby where are you?”  
“So you can talk to him with that thing in your ear?”  
Sandy questioned overhearing her daughter seemingly speaking to herself.  
“yes and that’s probably all I can do with him now thanks to you”  
Sandy walked off to give her daughter space hearing her tone of voice and the press below with their tiny vans began to follow wearily in her footsteps.  
“Im by your ankles and making my way up keep still darling”  
Zal cautioned as in his forward view screen he saw nothing but Tiffani’s legs. He flew into the valley between them and instead of continuing up his Tallion curiosity got the better of him and he detoured to see her sex and how it appeared at this grand scale. As seemingly miles of her sexy inner thighs rolled past his view on either side of his tiny craft he nearly choked as he took in the monstrous proportions of her titanic sex.  
“Zal I can’t see you yet baby?”  
“Im err looking at you Tiffani… im looking at the largest female organ in the universe!”  
He blurted out and Tiffani smiled looking down between her legs. She could just about see a tiny glint of metal hovering there.  
“trust you Zal, wanna see some more?”  
Following her teasing words she reached her fingers to the giant lips that sealed her gargantuan pussy and parted them to display herself to her minute boyfriend.  
With the moist inner flesh revealed Zal was just knocked for six by her dimensions. He knew she could probably hide an entire fleet of Tallion military transport ships inside her and still have room for a several freighters larger than his own!  
“Tiffani you are a real goddess to me now this is unbelievable , I think you could pick up the tallest building in Tallion Prime and use it to pleasure yourself with!”  
“Zal , if you think this is impressive why don’t you come up and visit the two mountains above I know they are your real favorite”  
With such an invitation Zal was swiftly engaging his thrusters to rise up the length of her body. Even the widest of his forward electronic view screens couldn’t display Tiffani’s body and he caught just snippets of the beautiful terrain such as her navel which he could have landed his ship inside. Mountainous was the correct description of her bare breasts as Zal began to rise slowly between them. He imagined her teasingly pressing those humongous walls of flesh inwards and gulped dryly at how easy it would be for her to extinguish his life right now. When he toured the outside he couldn’t help getting aroused at her extreme proportions.  
“Wow is all I can say to these! Tiffani there are no words to describe them I cant begin to imagine how big these are!”  
“like real sexy mountains eh Zal?”  
There was a small silence as Zal contemplated something in his mind.  
“Tiffani before I leave Idd like to be close to you one more time, and I think I can  
land my ship on your nipple that way you may even feel me there where its sensitive”  
“Idd like that Zal I will try to keep these as still as I can”  
With her permission he landed the craft onto her surprisingly generous nipple length.  
“Tiffani ive landed did you feel that?”  
“Yes, it tickled but I can still hardly make your ship out”  
“Im going to step out in a minute but please don’t try to talk until I say im not sure my ears could stand that so close to you”  
“Ok, my teeny explorer but I warn you im already feeling aroused knowing your on my nipple”  
Zal left his ship and looked out onto the massive nipple, its surface was imperfect at this scale like a planet he once visited in the Terras system. Touching down his feet he was in total wonder at just how small his ship was to her and how even smaller he was. It didn’t seem to him like he was on a human being at all. The nipple was almost unrecognizable for his eyes to take in. As he walked along it he dared to look up at her body behind hoping to catch her face but all he could see was the sheer wall of her areola that spanned out in all directions and beyond that the main breast that filled his view as it towered over him. What was also noticeable beneath his feet was the feeling of movement below the surface , perhaps blood circulating he wondered and this was verified as he actually felt the terrain expand.  
“Tiffani this is incredible I can actually see your nipple expanding as your getting more turned on its shifting and swelling under my feet”  
When this sensation passed he was now stood on a much larger area and his ship seemed even further away from where he had left it. Zal knelt down and kissed the warmth and knew she would never be able to appreciate such a gesture from a man so tiny.  
“I am going to miss you goddess Tiffani”  
Minutes later Zal was in his ship and began to hover above Tiffani and the world of blonde hair below.  
“Tiffani that’s it im afraid I have to go now and return to Tallion”  
“Oh Zal I will miss you so much”  
“Tiffani I swear I will try to find some way to reduce your height so you can live again a normal life , believe me I will do what it takes”  
“I believe you Zal, but it isn’t so bad really , parts of this may even be fun we certainly make an impact in this world my mother and I and I think we are pretty famous now”  
“I have med-scans of both of you and Ill hand the data in as soon as I get back Tiffani”  
“I know you will Zal my biggest regret is that I can’t kiss you goodbye my little love”  
He heard her sniff as large tears began to roll down her face.  
  
Two weeks later and Zal was sat by the gravity swell pools on the coast line of Tallion looking off into the distance and contemplating his next communication with Tiffani. He was pleased to hear that she was enjoying life as the tallest woman on earth. She had been meeting celebrities and had interviews with all the major media networks in the world. She received a lot of questions and had to endure some long sessions with military organizations at first with interrogations about her size and alien connections that had emerged yet being so colossal she didn’t let them intimidate her and told them only what she wanted to say. Aside from this the positives to being a giantess was that she would get invited with her mother to attend social functions where she could use her size to offer rides to children and even some adults. She was even able to make a living outside of her celebrity status working to help build bridges and to help construction companies with certain key projects. She remarked to Zal that lifting hundreds of tons was nothing to her now. Her mother and father had patched things up and he had even left his job to become a manager for Sandy promoting his giant wife.  
The forgiveness between them was very touching for Tiffani and she was always keeping an eye on her mother just incase she decided to get out of hand again.  
Zal’s time back on Tallion however wasn’t as pleasant. Having revealed his experiences on earth and the results of what had transpired leaving two alien females as giantesses  
his father who had recovered from his temporary illness was not impressed. Their relationship was strained to say the least but he was impressed with his sons honesty and feeling of responsibility for his actions and helped Zal to engage with Tallions scientific community and medical experts so they could analyze the medical scans he took back with him hoping they would find some way of reversing the raytron exposure Tiffani and Sandy received. It was the results of these scans that Zal held looking at as the video tablet resting on his knees as he called into the com-crystal.  
“Tiffani its Zal”  
“Hey baby you ok?”  
Her voice seemed upbeat and happy he was thankful for this  
“Yeh fine, its seems my father is starting to come around and im even trusted to go out on long hauls again”  
“that’s great can you just hold on a second Im just in the middle handling some cargo myself”  
Tiffani stood up to her knees in water within in a small port unloading a container ship and stacking the huge metal freight containers onto the portside completing a task in twenty minutes that normally took a huge work force and various cranes and forklifts a full working day.  
“there that’s better, sorry Zal im all yours now”  
“I have the first results of the medical scans…”  
He began slowly and paused  
“and?”  
“You and your mother are both completely healthy and infact unusually healthy thanks to the raytron in your systems , they figure you wont catch so much as a cold and you should be experiencing Tallion style urges”  
“You mean Ive gained your sex drive”  
“Is that true Tiffani?”  
She laughed  
“Mother and I need to relieve ourselves three times a day and we are running out of giant playthings to use to satisfy ourselves they kind of break easily with big girls like us You know I did try working with some big tree trunks for a while but they don’t last long and they are kind of skinny. Infact the government is having some huge dildo’s manufactured for us both so we can get the pleasure we need. I think they are worried we may become unruly if we aren’t satisfied , its quite a side effect but one I actually enjoy”  
“sort of a female burning you know how I feel now”  
Zal then changed his tone to speak further and this time with some startling news.  
“now Tiffani you have to brace yourself for what im going to say next”  
“Ok im ready. Is it that there is no solution to shrinking us back down because im actually not that bothered life is good Zal being nearly 500ft tall feels normal to me”  
“well that we are still working on but nothing is coming to light yet its actually something else I have to let you know, something important”  
“go on”  
“Your pregnant”  
“What!”  
Tiffani nearly fell over  
“Pregnant that’s impossible isn’t it?”  
”Would you have said being 500ft tall was impossible a month ago and having a boyfriend who is less than 2 inches tall from outer space”  
“Your right but how?”  
“Some how my sperm despite its size has managed to perform the impossible the scientists and doctors went through it but I simply don’t understand myself it something due to the unique things going on in your body with the raytrons effect.”  
“So you’re the father, Zal this isn’t bad news Ill have someone close to care for someone that will remind me of you”  
“actually there’s more”  
“go on”  
“your mother is also pregnant”  
“Oh my god, really? Wait to she hears this one dads gonna flip!....Hey Zal will the baby be relative to my new size? I mean am I going to have a giant baby?”  
“This is difficult”  
Zal began preparing her for more news  
“You both are having more than one baby”  
“Twins?”  
After a deep breathe Zal continued  
“You have thirty one babies inside you and your mother has twenty four”  
There was a silence  
“Tiffani the babies are normal human sized at present and they figure you will give birth to them very easily in less than 1 month”  
”one month what happened to the rest of the months?”  
“don’t ask me I have no idea, but Tiffani there’s even more…”  
“based on the analysis of the data the babies will all be female, and all of them will grow somewhere around your size by the time they finish puberty”  
“Oh my god”  
“and finally although they are hypothesizing with this they think that human male sperm will make them pregnant despite the size difference and all of our daughters could have the potential for multiple baby girls who could turn again into giant women!”  
  
They both continued to talk into the early hours of the next day and as Zal walked home he sighed to himself as he imagined what earth might be like in the future as his many daughters hit puberty and began to discover their hunger for sex…….
